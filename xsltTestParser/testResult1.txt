The author employs musicology alongside jurisprudence to highlight the scope for reform in copyright law, towards an originality assessment that more accurately reflects the cyclical, social collective-reality of musical composition. </em>  </div> <a id="co_anchor_3"></a><h2 class="co_headtext">Introduction</h2><div class="co_paragraph"> Keith Richards, the guitarist and songwriter for the iconic rock ’n’ roll band the Rolling Stones, once declared: "There’s really only one song … and Adam and Eve probably sung it; everything else is a variation on it."<sup id="co_footnoteReference_1"><a href="#co_footnote_1" class="co_footnoteReference">1</a></sup> Many commentators believe that music is rarely (if ever) original, but rather something sourced elsewhere and built upon or adapted by composers and songwriters over time. If one were to accept this, then how could music ever be original enough to be claimed by one creator as the product of his or her own, individual efforts? Nevertheless, the law of copyright is founded on the concept of the original work. When an original work is created, copyright is deemed to subsist in that work and certain exclusive rights are conferred on the author. Thus, the legal basis for the subsistence of copyright is the antithesis of a co-operative view of music creation. Copyright recognises originality in music and consequently binds a musical work to its author in the form of private property rights to be protected or exploited for a prescribed period. Such exclusive rights can also be assigned to successive right holders during the copyright term. Therefore, copyright law prescribes that music can in fact be owned—it does not simply belong to "Adam and Eve". </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The scope for originality in music is challenged in this article through an examination of the musical tools and technical and stylistic conventions that make up Western music. It will be shown how the culmination of these elements dictates that musical works cannot in every case be unique or original for the purpose of copyright subsistence, and that all music fashioned out of such conventions is necessarily related. Originality as a legal concept is then explored via a two-pronged approach, based on the "substantial originality" and "substantial reproduction" tests developed by the courts in both common and civil law jurisdictions. An examination of the "substantial originality" test highlights its significance (and underuse) in infringement actions concerning musical works; whereas an examination of the "substantial reproduction" test, preferred by courts in cases concerning unauthorised reproductions of musical works, exposes the limits of the originality concept in copyright law in recognising the communal nature of music creation. Ultimately, this article espouses an originality test in copyright law that recognises cyclic compositional practice. </div> <a id="co_anchor_4"></a><h2 class="co_headtext">Music—an evolutionary art form</h2><div class="co_paragraph"> "Music may happen to be expressive, communicative, moving and inspired, but it is rarely accidental …."<sup id="co_footnoteReference_2"><a href="#co_footnote_2" class="co_footnoteReference">2</a></sup> The qualification in this statement illustrates a key premise underpinning musicology—that music almost always originated from somewhere, something or someone else. Whether any piece of music can be deemed truly original is a question that requires a robust analysis of the origins and development of music as we perceive it today. A comprehensive examination has been avoided here in favour of a selective study of the evolution of Western music and the cultural conditions within which it resides. Throughout, the reader is directed to observe the cyclical nature of music—how it evolved into common styles and genres, and the intuitive sharing between creators, both conscious and unconscious, that incessantly occurs. Such observations call into question the method by which musical expression is attributed to a single author for the purpose of a finding of originality in copyright law. </div><h3 class="co_headtext"><i>Genesis of music</i></h3><div class="co_paragraph"> The creation of music has been traced back to ancient times.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_3"><a href="#co_footnote_3" class="co_footnoteReference">3</a></sup> Nature is often credited as the original composer’s muse—the phenomenon out of which musical sounds were first imitated and built.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_4"><a href="#co_footnote_4" class="co_footnoteReference">4</a></sup> Thus, the impetus for <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S34E2F2309C0711E4ABBBADAAA4F7D653&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;67&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*67" />*E.I.P.R. 67</span>  singing and producing musical sounds appears to have grown out of humankind’s environment. Philosophers, like Aristotle and Lucretius, theorised that music grew out of man’s desire to imitate sounds in nature, first with voice and then with crudely made instruments.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_5"><a href="#co_footnote_5" class="co_footnoteReference">5</a></sup> Consequently, music is not confined to man-made melody, harmony and rhythm—it can be found in sources as organic as the sound of wind in the trees, the ebb and flow of the ocean, laughter and even (albeit controversially) silence.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_6"><a href="#co_footnote_6" class="co_footnoteReference">6</a></sup> Out of such phenomena the elements of music such as tonality, pattern, rhythm and repetition were cultivated by society over the ages. Clearly, music has existed and evolved since the dawn of humanity. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Rhythm, melody and harmony make up the essential "raw materials"<sup id="co_footnoteReference_7"><a href="#co_footnote_7" class="co_footnoteReference">7</a></sup> out of which much of Western music is fashioned and produced.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_8"><a href="#co_footnote_8" class="co_footnoteReference">8</a></sup> A consideration of these elements challenges the concept of originality in musical works, by highlighting how particular material combinations are consistently formed in particular contexts and how their repetition or imitation has become an indispensable tool of musical expression for composers and songwriters. </div><h3 class="co_headtext">Rhythm</h3><div class="co_paragraph"> Rhythm, or the timing at which musical notes and sounds (and silences) are produced, is one of the most basic and crucial of the musical elements. The development of rhythmic formulae and patterns was instigated by the evolution of language and communication and the imparting of knowledge through storytelling.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_9"><a href="#co_footnote_9" class="co_footnoteReference">9</a></sup> Pre-literate humans would store knowledge in tales or songs, whose repetition was based on "commonplaces", i.e. set to verbal formulae and themes.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_10"><a href="#co_footnote_10" class="co_footnoteReference">10</a></sup> These would feature complex but conspicuously similar rhythmic patterns as a method by which the storyteller could remember the essential unvarying segments of the story.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_11"><a href="#co_footnote_11" class="co_footnoteReference">11</a></sup> Linguistic theory points to the origins of rhythmic music in speech:  </div><div class="co_paragraph"> "[A] basic problem for language origins is how sequences became fixed for entire communities, so that everyone could repeat them exactly. Music making, in all human communities, is also based on the ability to repeat sequences exactly. I suggest that the original process of fixing sequences into recognizable, repeatable, and significant definite somethings by entire communities was accomplished by speech and music making in exactly the same way and by the same means. In other words, in the beginning, speech and music making were one and the same: they were collective, real-time repetitions of formulaic sequences." <sup id="co_footnoteReference_12"><a href="#co_footnote_12" class="co_footnoteReference">12</a></sup> </div><div class="co_paragraph">  This emphasis on the evolution of repeated formulaic sequences seems to accord with the evolutionary path of music. Repetition became an essential feature of Western composition with its prescribed timing and equal subdivisions of pulses or notes. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The elements of rhythm are realised in the Western notation system under three broad categories—tempo, metre and rhythmic pattern. First, tempo is usually measured in pulses (i.e. beats) per minute. When manipulated, it can alter the mood of a composition and the emotional response of a listener. Secondly, metre is the grouping of rhythmic pulses or note values into repetitive metrical patterns "which provide the underlying skeleton for rhythm".<sup id="co_footnoteReference_13"><a href="#co_footnote_13" class="co_footnoteReference">13</a></sup> Simple quadruple (4/4), imparts four pulses to each bar<sup id="co_footnoteReference_14"><a href="#co_footnote_14" class="co_footnoteReference">14</a></sup> of music and is one of the most commonly used metres.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_15"><a href="#co_footnote_15" class="co_footnoteReference">15</a></sup> Simple triple (3/4) gives three pulses to each bar, as found in waltzes and country and western songs.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_16"><a href="#co_footnote_16" class="co_footnoteReference">16</a></sup> Lastly, rhythmic pattern can be used to describe everything else in rhythm that falls outside of metre and tempo. This element is particularly associated with the melody in music. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The development of rhythmic patterns with an emphasis on repetition for reproduction by humans, initially vocally and later through instruments, maintains the essential purpose of rhythm as a formulaic sequence to be passed on from generation to generation. Such generational impartation over centuries of musical evolution presents some difficulty in finding for rhythmic originality in Western music. <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S34E2F2309C0711E4ABBBADAAA4F7D653&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;68&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*68" />*E.I.P.R. 68</span>  </div><h3 class="co_headtext">Melody</h3><div class="co_paragraph"> Melody is one element of music that most composers claim as their original creation.

Melodies in Western music are predominantly fashioned out of fixed and easily distinguished recurring patterns that logically lead the tune to its natural conclusion.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_18"><a href="#co_footnote_18" class="co_footnoteReference">18</a></sup> This is largely achieved through the use of scales, the musical tones to which Western instruments are tuned.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_19"><a href="#co_footnote_19" class="co_footnoteReference">19</a></sup> The particular intervals or tonal steps taken from the first tone (i.e. the tonic) dictate the mode of the scale.

Major and minor keys, with their intervals suited to reinforcing the central triad, continued to dominate melodies throughout the baroque, classical (c.1730–1820 and romantic (c.1815–1910) periods.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_29"><a href="#co_footnote_29" class="co_footnoteReference">29</a></sup> As music became more experimental during the 20th century, composers utilised a greater variety of scales than those employed during any other historical period.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_30"><a href="#co_footnote_30" class="co_footnoteReference">30</a></sup> The chromatic scale was widely explored by composers wishing to push the boundaries of tonality after centuries of composition in mostly major or minor scales.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_31"><a href="#co_footnote_31" class="co_footnoteReference">31</a></sup> Medieval modes also made a comeback and the influence of modal tonality can be found in genres as recent as jazz,<sup id="co_footnoteReference_32"><a href="#co_footnote_32" class="co_footnoteReference">32</a></sup> blues<sup id="co_footnoteReference_33"><a href="#co_footnote_33" class="co_footnoteReference">33</a></sup> and contemporary pop music.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_34"><a href="#co_footnote_34" class="co_footnoteReference">34</a></sup> It can even be found in the theme music to video games.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_35"><a href="#co_footnote_35" class="co_footnoteReference">35</a></sup> The enduring relevance of Western tonality in its earlier incarnations demonstrates society’s enthusiasm for music of the past.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_36"><a href="#co_footnote_36" class="co_footnoteReference">36</a></sup> This encourages composers to borrow from earlier works for the purpose of continuing ancient traditions, creating "new" pieces of music or satisfying consumer listening trends. <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S34E2F2309C0711E4ABBBADAAA4F7D653&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;69&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*69" />*E.I.P.R. 69</span>  </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Furthermore, Western melodies often conform to a preconceived structure, depending on the genre or composition style utilised. Pop, folk, rock ’n’ roll and most other sub-genres falling under the popular banner usually employ one or two melodies that repeat in a formulaic "verse/chorus" pattern. Classical compositions often begin on a melodic theme, which is then varied through each movement (e.g. theme and variations or sonatas). Jazz musicians invoke the same process in a more organic fashion by taking the melody as a "lead" or "head" from which to improvise. Thus, we see the significance of the structured, melodic-compositional framework that developed to define and constrain originality in much of Western composition. </div><h3 class="co_headtext"><i>Originality and universality</i></h3><div class="co_paragraph"> The above discussion reveals that the use of prescribed scales, keys and structures to fashion melodic lines gave rise to a listener’s dependency on Western tonality in order to make auditory sense of the sounds. The tones and patterns of a melody must possess a cultural relevancy to each other: "The unity and mobility of a melody is not in the melody itself, but actually in the listener’s mind".<sup id="co_footnoteReference_37"><a href="#co_footnote_37" class="co_footnoteReference">37</a></sup> The corollary of this is that a melody can only become a melody when we are accustomed in our expectations as to how a melody should sound, such that even when hearing a melody for the first time, we are so familiar with its tonal context that we have, in theory, already heard it before. This is a likely explanation for the universal psychological reactions to music felt by humans, where certain series of musical tones can predictably instil particular moods or tensions in listeners. Musicologists propounding a universal theory of music point to the fact that octaves are perceived as equivalent in almost all cultures, that most scales of the world are built out of seven or fewer pitches per octave, that most of the world’s rhythmic patterns are built out of divisive blocks of two or three beats, and that emotional excitement in music is universally expressed through loud, fast, accelerating and high-registered sound patterns.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_38"><a href="#co_footnote_38" class="co_footnoteReference">38</a></sup> The significance of these universal features has been explained from a psychological perspective:  </div><div class="co_paragraph"> "[S]ince all music originates in the minds of individual people, and since all minds are assumed to possess similar psychological characteristics, it is taken that there will be a certain conformity of patterning or structure between all music and all minds." <sup id="co_footnoteReference_39"><a href="#co_footnote_39" class="co_footnoteReference">39</a></sup> </div><div class="co_paragraph">  The 20th-century composer Arnold Schoenberg<sup id="co_footnoteReference_40"><a href="#co_footnote_40" class="co_footnoteReference">40</a></sup> neatly summed up music’s dependency on universality when stating: "A [musical] theme should have a certain something which the whole world already knows."<sup id="co_footnoteReference_41"><a href="#co_footnote_41" class="co_footnoteReference">41</a></sup> These statements situate the lack of originality in music founded in universality and verify the cyclical phenomenon of music creation. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> It follows that culture and experience affect the human interpretation of, and empathy with, music. What is melodically or harmonically coherent to a certain culture at a particular time may be to another just a random series of tones without unity. An anecdote among classical musicians illustrates this point well. A Japanese visitor attending an orchestral concert in 19th-century London was asked by his British hosts which movement of the performance he preferred. He answered "the first one", in fact referring to the random and atonal collection of sounds made by the orchestra while warming up. This story illustrates the cultural disparity between Eastern and Western tonality at that time, and points to music’s dependency on familiarity in the mind of the listener. A finding of true originality in Western music is hampered by its enslavement to pre-ordained tonal, melodic and harmonic patterns. These demonstrate how a composition’s essential tonal and mechanical framework is rarely original or unique, but something that stems from the tuning over time of the Western ear to predetermined sequences. </div><h3 class="co_headtext"><i>Harmony and the cultural context</i></h3><div class="co_paragraph"> The effect of two or more tones sounding simultaneously in a vertical or chordal structure is termed harmony.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_42"><a href="#co_footnote_42" class="co_footnoteReference">42</a></sup> Composing to a set, chordal framework or chord progression arose during the baroque period and continues today as a principal compositional tool. An important feature of harmony is whether a combination of tones at intervals to one another is consonant or dissonant to the ear, i.e. pleasant and agreeable or harsh and inharmonious respectively.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_43"><a href="#co_footnote_43" class="co_footnoteReference">43</a></sup> Western scales contain companion tones that form consonant combinations. Companion tones differ between the various types of scales, depending on the spacing of the intervals between the tones. The pairing of a tone with any other note than its companion tone is generally considered to produce dissonance.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_44"><a href="#co_footnote_44" class="co_footnoteReference">44</a></sup> The existence of consonance and dissonance in harmony portrays how tonality involves a relationship with the sonic experience existing in any given culture or context. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The anecdote about the Japanese tourist demonstrates how what is consonant or dissonant to one’s ear depends upon the cultural conditioning of the listener. For <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S34E2F2309C0711E4ABBBADAAA4F7D653&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;70&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*70" />*E.I.P.R. 70</span>  example, the unusual dissonances employed in the neo-classicist style by Igor Stravinsky<sup id="co_footnoteReference_45"><a href="#co_footnote_45" class="co_footnoteReference">45</a></sup> received very adverse reactions from early audiences. In 1913, Stravinsky’s seminal work <em>The Rite of Spring</em> divided critics at the time as to its merit.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_46"><a href="#co_footnote_46" class="co_footnoteReference">46</a></sup> It is now heralded worldwide as a masterpiece, demonstrating how social perceptions of what is harmonically and sonically acceptable can transform over time. It is therefore possible for the classically trained ear to step outside the confines of traditional melodic and harmonic structures and accept new harmonic prospects. Interestingly, the "shockingly" new and unfamiliar sounds that so repulsed early audiences of <em>The Rite of Spring</em> were in fact based on the tribal beats and dances of primitive man.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_47"><a href="#co_footnote_47" class="co_footnoteReference">47</a></sup> What is often perceived as original in Western music "ain’t necessarily so".<sup id="co_footnoteReference_48"><a href="#co_footnote_48" class="co_footnoteReference">48</a></sup> </div><div class="co_paragraph"> It appears that culture and context act to curb originality by limiting the choices of musical propositions available to creators. A composer who wishes to write a lullaby could not utilise loud, fast and frantic rhythms or clashing, dissonant chords—it wouldn’t sound "right". More acceptable would be pleasant, consonant harmonies sounded at a relaxing pace. Context dictates what is acceptable and the composer must conform to be validated, thus limiting the scope for originality. </div><h3 class="co_headtext"><i>Contextual multiplicity</i></h3><div class="co_paragraph"> The impact of context on music finds particular relevance to an examination of the manner in which music is received by the listener. A linguist once wrote that "the meaning of the word does not exist apart from its context".<sup id="co_footnoteReference_49"><a href="#co_footnote_49" class="co_footnoteReference">49</a></sup> This concept could apply equally to music to distinguish similarities in musical expression between works occupying distinct contexts. For example, the interlude from a romantic pop ballad played during the bridal procession at a wedding ceremony would convey a joyful meaning and impart feelings of love and happiness. The same interlude played during a funeral procession would convey a sorrowful meaning and impart feelings of loss and sadness. It is <em>heard</em> differently in each case, despite remaining the same in form and structure. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> A further example is in film scores. The shower scene in <em>Psycho</em>,<sup id="co_footnoteReference_50"><a href="#co_footnote_50" class="co_footnoteReference">50</a></sup> utilising a minimalist strings-only orchestra playing in their topmost registers, created one of the most horrifying musical cues of all time.

Therefore, in striving to fit music within a certain genre or generate a desired emotional response, the creator is forced to take inspiration from the musical canon and is unavoidably drawn further away from true originality. Yet at the heart of copyright is the requirement of originality, which is present in the statutory definition of a "work".<sup id="co_footnoteReference_53"><a href="#co_footnote_53" class="co_footnoteReference">53</a></sup> Giving the stamp of originality to a work necessarily involves an exclusion of elements that are not original. This ensures that only the author’s unique efforts are justly copyrightable—creators still need a language to write in or musical chords to compose with. Copyright law addresses this: before a work is declared original, a distinction is made to isolate the elements that are prima facie excluded from protection via the expression requirement. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Fundamentally, copyright does not protect ideas, only the author’s original expression of ideas.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_54"><a href="#co_footnote_54" class="co_footnoteReference">54</a></sup> Thus, music in its raw, unformulated sense is a collection of unprotectable ideas. Assembling these ideas constitutes protected, creative expression (i.e. an original work). Therefore, whether a work constitutes the author’s own expression is intrinsically linked to the concept of originality. <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S34E2F2309C0711E4ABBBADAAA4F7D653&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;71&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*71" />*E.I.P.R. 71</span>  </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In addition to ideas, other unprotectable elements include facts, matters in the public domain, principles, procedures and <em> scènes à faire </em>.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_55"><a href="#co_footnote_55" class="co_footnoteReference">55</a></sup><em>Scènes à faire</em> (i.e. scenes which must be done), when used in the context of music, describe the events that must logically follow from the theme or premise on which a work is based.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_56"><a href="#co_footnote_56" class="co_footnoteReference">56</a></sup> Its features are necessarily generated from the rules and forces that dictate the harmonic structures and progressions in music, which occur as a result of satisfying compositional impulses.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_57"><a href="#co_footnote_57" class="co_footnoteReference">57</a></sup> Concluding a musical work with a perfect cadence<sup id="co_footnoteReference_58"><a href="#co_footnote_58" class="co_footnoteReference">58</a></sup> is one of the most commonly used endings in Western music and is unprotectable.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_59"><a href="#co_footnote_59" class="co_footnoteReference">59</a></sup> Also unprotectable is the popular 12-bar blues harmonic progression.

The issue for infringement disputes is whether the author can claim that a particular musical expression is of their own creation. It is arguable that an unequivocal determination of originality is difficult to make using the idea/expression threshold, because much of musical expression will necessarily draw from the same pool of ideas. If there is an originality threshold in music, it must be random. It cannot be fixed at the point at which musical ideas are expressed, since almost all Western music works off the same musical system and formulae and lends itself to reiteration. Even if it is clear at which point a collection of musical ideas becomes an expression of those ideas, is it fair to say that in every case such expression becomes the creator’s own, private property? If musical compositions do feed off each other, then either all of music is completely original or none is. An unequivocal test has not been established to ascertain when a musical work that resembles a precedent work can be legally classified as an original work. If there is little room for true originality in Western music, then copyright law must confront this when awarding proprietary rights to authors. If originality is recognised as possible in music, then greater emphasis must be placed on distinguishing features that allow evolutionary, co-operative creative practice to coexist with copyright. </div> <a id="co_anchor_12"></a><h2 class="co_headtext">Determining originality at law—a two-pronged approach</h2><div class="co_paragraph"> "Originality is the art of concealing your sources."Anon. </div><div class="co_paragraph">  Having regard to the process of music creation, it is not surprising that, occasionally, authors unintentionally create near-identical musical works. Where a dispute arises because of striking similarities to another work, copyright’s system of protecting authors belies its blunt, subjective slant on originality. Even where it is obvious which work was created first in time, copyright may still subsist in the latter if it is clear that it had not copied the former. Right holders cannot stop copyright from subsisting in another’s work because it resembles their own.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_64"><a href="#co_footnote_64" class="co_footnoteReference">64</a></sup> Rather, they can only enforce the exclusive rights granted to them, such as the sole right to reproduce, adapt, broadcast, give public performances or distribute copies of their work. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Fundamentally, originality acts to identify the author and assists the reward function of copyright. It ensures that copyright will only subsist in a work arising from that author’s intellectual labours.

Being second in time raises <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S34E2F2309C0711E4ABBBADAAA4F7D653&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;72&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*72" />*E.I.P.R. 72</span>  a case to answer whether the author has copied from the pre-existing work—if so, it could not be "original". Alternatively, a qualitative approach requires that the work attain a certain level of sophistication beyond a generic yardstick before it can be "original". The first interpretation assumes copyright subsists in the first-in-time work, only awarding originality to a later, similar or identical work where infringement of the first author’s copyright is absent. Here, originality is viewed from an enforcement perspective. The latter interpretation focuses on the work’s eligibility for copyright protection, determining originality from a subsistence perspective. </div><h3 class="co_headtext"><i>Enforcement versus subsistence</i></h3><div class="co_paragraph"> Because "originality" is not defined in any of the copyright statutes of common law jurisdictions, judicial tests ensure that the substantive originality requirement for copyright subsistence is fulfilled, generally in line with the qualitative approach. Courts around the world have created a diversity of tests guided by their own policy justifications. However, these tests were not derived in cases involving typically creative works, but where the subsistence of copyright was prima facie questionable owing to the non-artistic, generic nature of the work involved.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_65"><a href="#co_footnote_65" class="co_footnoteReference">65</a></sup> Where infringement of music is alleged, it is generally accepted that the plaintiff’s work, as an artistic creation, is original.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_66"><a href="#co_footnote_66" class="co_footnoteReference">66</a></sup> Instead of applying a qualitative test of "substantive originality", courts apply a "first-in-time" approach via a "substantial reproduction" test, examining whether the defendant reproduced the plaintiff’s work to a degree that infringed its copyright.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_67"><a href="#co_footnote_67" class="co_footnoteReference">67</a></sup> Therefore, it appears that a finding of originality has two limbs: first, whether the quality of the work deems it original, in the sense of not being generic or lacking individual creativity; and secondly, whether the work originated solely from the author. Further analysis below will suggest that the first limb, normally reserved for utilitarian-type works, may also be relevant to infringement actions concerning musical works. </div><h3 class="co_headtext"><i>Tests for substantial originality</i></h3><div class="co_paragraph"> The UK test for originality, known as the "sweat of the brow" doctrine, has characterised British judicial analysis of copyright subsistence, without dependence upon creativity or artisanship.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_68"><a href="#co_footnote_68" class="co_footnoteReference">68</a></sup> It focuses not on the nature of the work, but whether the author has either wholly or substantially reproduced a prior work.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_69"><a href="#co_footnote_69" class="co_footnoteReference">69</a></sup> The test betrays Britain’s industrialist past and its valuing of individual labour above intellectual pursuit. By focusing on individual effort and prohibiting unauthorised reproduction, it favours the enforcement interpretation over a qualitative approach to originality. Therefore, the "sweat of the brow" test for substantial originality in the UK appears to have functional equivalence to the "substantial reproduction" test. Such an approach seems out of harmony with the spirit of music-making, since reproduction of prior musical propositions appears to be at the core of Western composition. Further, a test of originality based on independent effort alone seems too broad, failing to address the importance of filtering out universal elements that are required to feed a "dynamic creative culture".<sup id="co_footnoteReference_70"><a href="#co_footnote_70" class="co_footnoteReference">70</a></sup> This test also seems to benefit creators by allowing "second-in-time" authors to escape liability for copyright infringement in music that may not be original or novel, if it can be proven that their work was merely coincidentally similar to a protected work.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_71"><a href="#co_footnote_71" class="co_footnoteReference">71</a></sup> </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The test that dominates civil legal systems sets a far higher threshold than its common law counterparts,<sup id="co_footnoteReference_72"><a href="#co_footnote_72" class="co_footnoteReference">72</a></sup> and demonstrates the very different philosophical stance that civil law courts take when awarding copyright to a work.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_73"><a href="#co_footnote_73" class="co_footnoteReference">73</a></sup> For example, an original work in France must reflect the author’s personality.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_74"><a href="#co_footnote_74" class="co_footnoteReference">74</a></sup> The German test goes further in requiring not only subjective individuality (<em>Individualität</em>), but also a minimal threshold of creativity (<em>Gestaltungshöhe</em>).<sup id="co_footnoteReference_75"><a href="#co_footnote_75" class="co_footnoteReference">75</a></sup> These tests are stricter, being necessarily subjective and requiring the mark of the author’s individual creativity.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_76"><a href="#co_footnote_76" class="co_footnoteReference">76</a></sup> The continental emphasis on artistic and intellectual creativity, compared with the sweat of the brow test favoured in British courts, ensures that uncertainty remains as to what precise elements are required for a finding of originality in musical works in civil law jurisdictions. <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S34E2F2309C0711E4ABBBADAAA4F7D653&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;73&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*73" />*E.I.P.R. 73</span>  </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Akin to the other jurisdictions examined here, "original" is not defined in the US statute, this task being left to the American courts.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_77"><a href="#co_footnote_77" class="co_footnoteReference">77</a></sup> The seminal case of  Feist Publications v Rural Telephone Service  (Feist) saw a departure from economic effort principles followed by other common law jurisdictions, bringing the US test for originality closer to civil law sentiments.

This ruling will have lasting repercussions, and I suspect not for the better … I believe what has won today is opportunistic greed, and what has suffered, is creative musical endeavour." <sup id="co_footnoteReference_132"><a href="#co_footnote_132" class="co_footnoteReference">132</a></sup> </div><div class="co_paragraph">  General public sentiment appears to accord with Hay’s opinions, with disdain echoing throughout the online community.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_133"><a href="#co_footnote_133" class="co_footnoteReference">133</a></sup> Interestingly, another blogger alleges that the melody of "Kookaburra" originates from a Welsh folk song "A Ei Di’r ’Deryn Du", "which is along the lines of ‘There you are sitting, black bird’, which shows the inspiration for [the author’s] own lyrics about a bird <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S34E2F2309C0711E4ABBBADAAA4F7D653&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;78&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*78" />*E.I.P.R. 78</span>  sitting in a tree".<sup id="co_footnoteReference_134"><a href="#co_footnote_134" class="co_footnoteReference">134</a></sup> Without verifying the accuracy of this assertion, at least it acknowledges the social proclivity towards evolutionary composition. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> So, if public sentiment belies that a wrong has been committed in the "Down Under" case, then perhaps copyright law is too blunt and "obstinate". The heavy focus on melody in the application of the substantial reproduction test by courts bolsters this. If the substantial originality test were applied to both songs in the first instance, then other distinctive musical elements could be uncovered, such as chord progressions, rhythm, structure, tonality and context. Drawing out the distinctive elements that gave each work its substantial originality under the substantial reproduction test is likely to have produced a very different outcome in the "Down Under" case. The original feature of "Kookaburra" was certainly its melody, but was this melody the same feature that rendered "Down Under" original? The flute melody in "Down Under", even in reproducing "Kookaburra", was a small part of the song’s overall arrangement, which contained other, distinct elements that made it an original composition before the flute riff was added. If the test for substantial reproduction had focused more on the distinctive parts of "Down Under", then despite the reproduction of the "Kookaburra" melody, evolutionary reproduction would not have collided with copyright to impinge on the originality of "Down Under". It remains now to ascertain how copyright could be reconciled with the realities of evolutionary composition to achieve an appropriate balance between authors’ rights and the public interest. </div> <a id="co_anchor_21"></a><h2 class="co_headtext">The capacity for reconciliation</h2><div class="co_paragraph"> "Originality is simply a fresh pair of eyes." Thomas Wentworth Higginson </div><div class="co_paragraph">  This article has portrayed Western music as a cyclic phenomenon. Yet this presents a conflict for the concept of the original work in copyright law. It has been shown that an original work must be at least the product of the author’s own labours and judgment or reflect the author’s unique personality and contain some "creative spark". A work cannot be original where it reproduces another.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_135"><a href="#co_footnote_135" class="co_footnoteReference">135</a></sup> Yet a corollary to the theory that all music is born out of at least one musical tradition is that reproduction is unavoidable. How then can the original musical work in copyright be reconciled with this reality? Where music in the fulfilment of its social purpose generates a co-dependency between creators and audiences, copyright should serve the interests of both sides. Where the legal concept of the original work fails to take account of commonality in music, it fails to balance the interests generated within this co-dependency. It is therefore questionable whether copyright serves the purpose of music when it hinges on an inflexible theory of originality. The following suggests approaches to assessing originality in copyright law that take account of music’s evolutionary characteristics. </div><h3 class="co_headtext"><i>A modified concept of originality</i></h3><div class="co_paragraph"> Considering the process of music creation expounded above, it is not surprising that courts are repeatedly faced with copyright infringement claims for musical works.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_136"><a href="#co_footnote_136" class="co_footnoteReference">136</a></sup> The "substantial reproduction" approach to originality for musical works is limited—both in its failure to justify the originality taken for granted in the plaintiff’s work and to give adequate weight to distinguishing elements in the defendant’s work. A presumption of originality allows right holders to arbitrarily enforce copyright against similar musical expression that may not be appropriate in every case. If greater analysis were directed at whether the plaintiff’s musical work was sufficiently original to proffer a legally enforceable proprietary right, or whether the defendant’s work was sufficiently distinctive notwithstanding the unauthorised reproduction, then perhaps the number of infringement allegations could be drastically reduced. For this to occur, the "substantial originality" test must account for commonality in musical works. Furthermore, this modified approach to originality must be fused to the "substantial reproduction" test to ensure its application in infringement disputes concerning musical works, rather than merely in disputes concerning generic, utilitarian works. This has in some sense been achieved under the British "substantial originality" test. Therefore, the principal focus for reform lies in acknowledging the collective nature of composition with further emphasis on distinguishing features rather than similarities of musical expression. </div><h3 class="co_headtext">Context as a distinguishing factor</h3><div class="co_paragraph"> The impact of context on how the listener receives music presents one avenue for reform. This approach is inferred in  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/ICA23C4C0BD0911DDB366A7A3A710BD7B/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">D’Almaine v Boosey</a> , where emphasis must be given to "whether the air taken is substantially the same with the original".<sup id="co_footnoteReference_137"><a href="#co_footnote_137" class="co_footnoteReference">137</a></sup> Although context did not receive much attention during deliberation on this principle in  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/IA9036380E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Francis Day</a> , it was the incidental focus of some analysis in the "Down Under" case.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_138"><a href="#co_footnote_138" class="co_footnoteReference">138</a></sup> However, Jacobson J’s heavy <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S34E2F2309C0711E4ABBBADAAA4F7D653&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;79&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*79" />*E.I.P.R. 79</span>  emphasis on the melodic identity between the shared phrases in the "Down Under" case appears to have significantly narrowed the application of this principle. It is arguable that despite the melodic identity between the two works, the "air" taken from "Kookaburra" was altered enough in feel, harmony, rhythm and genre to place it within a significantly distinct context from the original.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_139"><a href="#co_footnote_139" class="co_footnoteReference">139</a></sup> The harmonic changes that altered the original melody’s mood from "jolly or observational" to "whimsical or wistful"<sup id="co_footnoteReference_140"><a href="#co_footnote_140" class="co_footnoteReference">140</a></sup> and its treatment in a reggae-beat pop song instead of a 4/4 children’s nursery rhyme markedly differentiate it from the original "Kookaburra" work. Yet, the distinctive elements of "Down Under" stood no chance against the inflexible "substantial reproduction" test. If distinguishing factors like context were appreciated in originality analysis, the tests could enjoy much-needed flexibility towards recognising our cross-pollinating music culture. </div><h3 class="co_headtext">A dynamic originality standard</h3><div class="co_paragraph"> Since the threshold of originality in a musical work appears to exist at the equivocal point at which musical ideas are "expressed", a scaled originality standard could ground copyright in musical works more accurately. At the lower end of the spectrum, a standard based merely on industriousness in seeking only that a work not reproduce another tips the scale in favour of first-in-time right holders, to the detriment of the public interest in maintaining a healthy public domain that furthers creative innovation. At the higher end of the spectrum, a standard that allows for reproduction and recycling in music, but distinguishes this on grounds of authorial creativity and contextual distinctions, would better balance the policy scale. It could support both the public domain and rights holders by allowing creators to produce "original" works that draw from and build upon the works of others. Where this scale should rest must be determined on a case-by-case basis; the lower the standard applicable, the less strictly the author should be allowed to enforce his or her rights in the work. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> A single, dynamic standard based on creative choices of the author would depend on the category of the work.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_141"><a href="#co_footnote_141" class="co_footnoteReference">141</a></sup> In utilitarian works, choices based on functionality, efficiency or applicable standards and practices are excluded, whereas choices in artistic works are those which reflect the author’s personality.

It is not stated whether these phrases were commonplace by reason of the folk songs being out of copyright, or because they used <em>scènes à faire</em> compositional techniques.

An inflexible view of copyright subsistence in musical works muzzles musical expression that belongs to an ever-evolving compositional cycle. This problem is reflected in the saying "Where there’s a hit there’s a writ".<sup id="co_footnoteReference_150"><a href="#co_footnote_150" class="co_footnoteReference">150</a></sup> To ensure that creators are in a position to draw from the musical canon without infringing copyright, the concept of an original work in copyright law and the circumstances in which right holders can enforce their exclusive rights must be reformed. Current legal tests for copyright subsistence are too blunt to unequivocally accord originality to musical works in an atmosphere where much of musical expression feeds off its creative environment. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The substantial originality test must recognise commonplace elements in music, and this test must be triggered by musical works, rather than merely utilitarian works. In addition to scrutinising the originality of the plaintiff’s musical work in infringement disputes, the elements that render the defendant’s work original must be given greater weight in the comparative analysis of shared musical phrases. This is achieved to some extent under the "substantial reproduction" test, but this test fails to recognise the inevitability of reproduction in music and causal connections between musical works in today’s global society.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_151"><a href="#co_footnote_151" class="co_footnoteReference">151</a></sup> What constitutes an "original work" in copyright law must in every case be qualified by music’s cross-pollinating nature. Nevertheless, the importance of copyright and its aptitude for wealth creation in society cannot be discounted. Copyright has been rightly described as "the currency in which all sectors of the [music] industry trade".<sup id="co_footnoteReference_152"><a href="#co_footnote_152" class="co_footnoteReference">152</a></sup> Yet rewarding individuals with exclusive rights at the expense of collective creativity is counterintuitive, as evidenced in the vulnerability of popular music to legal attack.

If one were to accept this, then how could music ever be original enough to be claimed by one creator as the product of his or her own, individual efforts? Nevertheless, the law of copyright is founded on the concept of the original work. When an original work is created, copyright is deemed to subsist in that work and certain exclusive rights are conferred on the author. Thus, the legal basis for the subsistence of copyright is the antithesis of a co-operative view of music creation. Copyright recognises originality in music and consequently binds a musical work to its author in the form of private property rights to be protected or exploited for a prescribed period. Such exclusive rights can also be assigned to successive right holders during the copyright term. Therefore, copyright law prescribes that music can in fact be owned—it does not simply belong to "Adam and Eve". </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The scope for originality in music is challenged in this article through an examination of the musical tools and technical and stylistic conventions that make up Western music. It will be shown how the culmination of these elements dictates that musical works cannot in every case be unique or original for the purpose of copyright subsistence, and that all music fashioned out of such conventions is necessarily related. Originality as a legal concept is then explored via a two-pronged approach, based on the "substantial originality" and "substantial reproduction" tests developed by the courts in both common and civil law jurisdictions. An examination of the "substantial originality" test highlights its significance (and underuse) in infringement actions concerning musical works; whereas an examination of the "substantial reproduction" test, preferred by courts in cases concerning unauthorised reproductions of musical works, exposes the limits of the originality concept in copyright law in recognising the communal nature of music creation. Ultimately, this article espouses an originality test in copyright law that recognises cyclic compositional practice. </div></div> <div class="doc_division"><a id="co_anchor_4"></a><h2 class="co_headtext doc_headText">Music—an evolutionary art form</h2><div class="co_paragraph"> "Music may happen to be expressive, communicative, moving and inspired, but it is rarely accidental …."<sup id="co_footnoteReference_2"><a href="#co_footnote_2" class="co_footnoteReference">2</a></sup> The qualification in this statement illustrates a key premise underpinning musicology—that music almost always originated from somewhere, something or someone else. Whether any piece of music can be deemed truly original is a question that requires a robust analysis of the origins and development of music as we perceive it today. A comprehensive examination has been avoided here in favour of a selective study of the evolution of Western music and the cultural conditions within which it resides. Throughout, the reader is directed to observe the cyclical nature of music—how it evolved into common styles and genres, and the intuitive sharing between creators, both conscious and unconscious, that incessantly occurs.

Music making, in all human communities, is also based on the ability to repeat sequences exactly. I suggest that the original process of fixing sequences into recognizable, repeatable, and significant definite somethings by entire communities was accomplished by speech and music making in exactly the same way and by the same means. In other words, in the beginning, speech and music making were one and the same: they were collective, real-time repetitions of formulaic sequences." <sup id="co_footnoteReference_12"><a href="#co_footnote_12" class="co_footnoteReference">12</a></sup> </div><div class="co_paragraph">  This emphasis on the evolution of repeated formulaic sequences seems to accord with the evolutionary path of music. Repetition became an essential feature of Western composition with its prescribed timing and equal subdivisions of pulses or notes. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The elements of rhythm are realised in the Western notation system under three broad categories—tempo, metre and rhythmic pattern. First, tempo is usually measured in pulses (i.e. beats) per minute. When manipulated, it can alter the mood of a composition and the emotional response of a listener. Secondly, metre is the grouping of rhythmic pulses or note values into repetitive metrical patterns "which provide the underlying skeleton for rhythm".<sup id="co_footnoteReference_13"><a href="#co_footnote_13" class="co_footnoteReference">13</a></sup> Simple quadruple (4/4), imparts four pulses to each bar<sup id="co_footnoteReference_14"><a href="#co_footnote_14" class="co_footnoteReference">14</a></sup> of music and is one of the most commonly used metres.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_15"><a href="#co_footnote_15" class="co_footnoteReference">15</a></sup> Simple triple (3/4) gives three pulses to each bar, as found in waltzes and country and western songs.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_16"><a href="#co_footnote_16" class="co_footnoteReference">16</a></sup> Lastly, rhythmic pattern can be used to describe everything else in rhythm that falls outside of metre and tempo. This element is particularly associated with the melody in music. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The development of rhythmic patterns with an emphasis on repetition for reproduction by humans, initially vocally and later through instruments, maintains the essential purpose of rhythm as a formulaic sequence to be passed on from generation to generation.

Pop, folk, rock ’n’ roll and most other sub-genres falling under the popular banner usually employ one or two melodies that repeat in a formulaic "verse/chorus" pattern. Classical compositions often begin on a melodic theme, which is then varied through each movement (e.g. theme and variations or sonatas). Jazz musicians invoke the same process in a more organic fashion by taking the melody as a "lead" or "head" from which to improvise. Thus, we see the significance of the structured, melodic-compositional framework that developed to define and constrain originality in much of Western composition. </div><h3 class="co_headtext"><i>Originality and universality</i></h3><div class="co_paragraph"> The above discussion reveals that the use of prescribed scales, keys and structures to fashion melodic lines gave rise to a listener’s dependency on Western tonality in order to make auditory sense of the sounds. The tones and patterns of a melody must possess a cultural relevancy to each other: "The unity and mobility of a melody is not in the melody itself, but actually in the listener’s mind".<sup id="co_footnoteReference_37"><a href="#co_footnote_37" class="co_footnoteReference">37</a></sup> The corollary of this is that a melody can only become a melody when we are accustomed in our expectations as to how a melody should sound, such that even when hearing a melody for the first time, we are so familiar with its tonal context that we have, in theory, already heard it before. This is a likely explanation for the universal psychological reactions to music felt by humans, where certain series of musical tones can predictably instil particular moods or tensions in listeners. Musicologists propounding a universal theory of music point to the fact that octaves are perceived as equivalent in almost all cultures, that most scales of the world are built out of seven or fewer pitches per octave, that most of the world’s rhythmic patterns are built out of divisive blocks of two or three beats, and that emotional excitement in music is universally expressed through loud, fast, accelerating and high-registered sound patterns.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_38"><a href="#co_footnote_38" class="co_footnoteReference">38</a></sup> The significance of these universal features has been explained from a psychological perspective:  </div><div class="co_paragraph"> "[S]ince all music originates in the minds of individual people, and since all minds are assumed to possess similar psychological characteristics, it is taken that there will be a certain conformity of patterning or structure between all music and all minds." <sup id="co_footnoteReference_39"><a href="#co_footnote_39" class="co_footnoteReference">39</a></sup> </div><div class="co_paragraph">  The 20th-century composer Arnold Schoenberg<sup id="co_footnoteReference_40"><a href="#co_footnote_40" class="co_footnoteReference">40</a></sup> neatly summed up music’s dependency on universality when stating: "A [musical] theme should have a certain something which the whole world already knows."<sup id="co_footnoteReference_41"><a href="#co_footnote_41" class="co_footnoteReference">41</a></sup> These statements situate the lack of originality in music founded in universality and verify the cyclical phenomenon of music creation. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> It follows that culture and experience affect the human interpretation of, and empathy with, music. What is melodically or harmonically coherent to a certain culture at a particular time may be to another just a random series of tones without unity. An anecdote among classical musicians illustrates this point well. A Japanese visitor attending an orchestral concert in 19th-century London was asked by his British hosts which movement of the performance he preferred. He answered "the first one", in fact referring to the random and atonal collection of sounds made by the orchestra while warming up. This story illustrates the cultural disparity between Eastern and Western tonality at that time, and points to music’s dependency on familiarity in the mind of the listener. A finding of true originality in Western music is hampered by its enslavement to pre-ordained tonal, melodic and harmonic patterns. These demonstrate how a composition’s essential tonal and mechanical framework is rarely original or unique, but something that stems from the tuning over time of the Western ear to predetermined sequences. </div><h3 class="co_headtext"><i>Harmony and the cultural context</i></h3><div class="co_paragraph"> The effect of two or more tones sounding simultaneously in a vertical or chordal structure is termed harmony.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_42"><a href="#co_footnote_42" class="co_footnoteReference">42</a></sup> Composing to a set, chordal framework or chord progression arose during the baroque period and continues today as a principal compositional tool. An important feature of harmony is whether a combination of tones at intervals to one another is consonant or dissonant to the ear, i.e. pleasant and agreeable or harsh and inharmonious respectively.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_43"><a href="#co_footnote_43" class="co_footnoteReference">43</a></sup> Western scales contain companion tones that form consonant combinations. Companion tones differ between the various types of scales, depending on the spacing of the intervals between the tones.

It is therefore possible for the classically trained ear to step outside the confines of traditional melodic and harmonic structures and accept new harmonic prospects. Interestingly, the "shockingly" new and unfamiliar sounds that so repulsed early audiences of <em>The Rite of Spring</em> were in fact based on the tribal beats and dances of primitive man.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_47"><a href="#co_footnote_47" class="co_footnoteReference">47</a></sup> What is often perceived as original in Western music "ain’t necessarily so".<sup id="co_footnoteReference_48"><a href="#co_footnote_48" class="co_footnoteReference">48</a></sup> </div><div class="co_paragraph"> It appears that culture and context act to curb originality by limiting the choices of musical propositions available to creators. A composer who wishes to write a lullaby could not utilise loud, fast and frantic rhythms or clashing, dissonant chords—it wouldn’t sound "right". More acceptable would be pleasant, consonant harmonies sounded at a relaxing pace. Context dictates what is acceptable and the composer must conform to be validated, thus limiting the scope for originality. </div><h3 class="co_headtext"><i>Contextual multiplicity</i></h3><div class="co_paragraph"> The impact of context on music finds particular relevance to an examination of the manner in which music is received by the listener.

For example, the interlude from a romantic pop ballad played during the bridal procession at a wedding ceremony would convey a joyful meaning and impart feelings of love and happiness. The same interlude played during a funeral procession would convey a sorrowful meaning and impart feelings of loss and sadness. It is <em>heard</em> differently in each case, despite remaining the same in form and structure. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> A further example is in film scores. The shower scene in <em>Psycho</em>,<sup id="co_footnoteReference_50"><a href="#co_footnote_50" class="co_footnoteReference">50</a></sup> utilising a minimalist strings-only orchestra playing in their topmost registers, created one of the most horrifying musical cues of all time.

Therefore, in striving to fit music within a certain genre or generate a desired emotional response, the creator is forced to take inspiration from the musical canon and is unavoidably drawn further away from true originality. Yet at the heart of copyright is the requirement of originality, which is present in the statutory definition of a "work".<sup id="co_footnoteReference_53"><a href="#co_footnote_53" class="co_footnoteReference">53</a></sup> Giving the stamp of originality to a work necessarily involves an exclusion of elements that are not original. This ensures that only the author’s unique efforts are justly copyrightable—creators still need a language to write in or musical chords to compose with.

It is arguable that an unequivocal determination of originality is difficult to make using the idea/expression threshold, because much of musical expression will necessarily draw from the same pool of ideas. If there is an originality threshold in music, it must be random. It cannot be fixed at the point at which musical ideas are expressed, since almost all Western music works off the same musical system and formulae and lends itself to reiteration. Even if it is clear at which point a collection of musical ideas becomes an expression of those ideas, is it fair to say that in every case such expression becomes the creator’s own, private property? If musical compositions do feed off each other, then either all of music is completely original or none is. An unequivocal test has not been established to ascertain when a musical work that resembles a precedent work can be legally classified as an original work. If there is little room for true originality in Western music, then copyright law must confront this when awarding proprietary rights to authors. If originality is recognised as possible in music, then greater emphasis must be placed on distinguishing features that allow evolutionary, co-operative creative practice to coexist with copyright. </div></div> <div class="doc_division"><a id="co_anchor_12"></a><h2 class="co_headtext doc_headText">Determining originality at law—a two-pronged approach</h2><div class="co_paragraph"> "Originality is the art of concealing your sources."Anon. </div><div class="co_paragraph">  Having regard to the process of music creation, it is not surprising that, occasionally, authors unintentionally create near-identical musical works. Where a dispute arises because of striking similarities to another work, copyright’s system of protecting authors belies its blunt, subjective slant on originality. Even where it is obvious which work was created first in time, copyright may still subsist in the latter if it is clear that it had not copied the former. Right holders cannot stop copyright from subsisting in another’s work because it resembles their own.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_64"><a href="#co_footnote_64" class="co_footnoteReference">64</a></sup> Rather, they can only enforce the exclusive rights granted to them, such as the sole right to reproduce, adapt, broadcast, give public performances or distribute copies of their work. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Fundamentally, originality acts to identify the author and assists the reward function of copyright. It ensures that copyright will only subsist in a work arising from that author’s intellectual labours. On one interpretation, the author must be first in time to express his or her work to claim exclusive copyright. Being second in time raises <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S34E2F2309C0711E4ABBBADAAA4F7D653&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;72&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*72" />*E.I.P.R. 72</span>  a case to answer whether the author has copied from the pre-existing work—if so, it could not be "original". Alternatively, a qualitative approach requires that the work attain a certain level of sophistication beyond a generic yardstick before it can be "original". The first interpretation assumes copyright subsists in the first-in-time work, only awarding originality to a later, similar or identical work where infringement of the first author’s copyright is absent. Here, originality is viewed from an enforcement perspective. The latter interpretation focuses on the work’s eligibility for copyright protection, determining originality from a subsistence perspective. </div><h3 class="co_headtext"><i>Enforcement versus subsistence</i></h3><div class="co_paragraph"> Because "originality" is not defined in any of the copyright statutes of common law jurisdictions, judicial tests ensure that the substantive originality requirement for copyright subsistence is fulfilled, generally in line with the qualitative approach. Courts around the world have created a diversity of tests guided by their own policy justifications. However, these tests were not derived in cases involving typically creative works, but where the subsistence of copyright was prima facie questionable owing to the non-artistic, generic nature of the work involved.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_65"><a href="#co_footnote_65" class="co_footnoteReference">65</a></sup> Where infringement of music is alleged, it is generally accepted that the plaintiff’s work, as an artistic creation, is original.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_66"><a href="#co_footnote_66" class="co_footnoteReference">66</a></sup> Instead of applying a qualitative test of "substantive originality", courts apply a "first-in-time" approach via a "substantial reproduction" test, examining whether the defendant reproduced the plaintiff’s work to a degree that infringed its copyright.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_67"><a href="#co_footnote_67" class="co_footnoteReference">67</a></sup> Therefore, it appears that a finding of originality has two limbs: first, whether the quality of the work deems it original, in the sense of not being generic or lacking individual creativity; and secondly, whether the work originated solely from the author. Further analysis below will suggest that the first limb, normally reserved for utilitarian-type works, may also be relevant to infringement actions concerning musical works. </div><h3 class="co_headtext"><i>Tests for substantial originality</i></h3><div class="co_paragraph"> The UK test for originality, known as the "sweat of the brow" doctrine, has characterised British judicial analysis of copyright subsistence, without dependence upon creativity or artisanship.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_68"><a href="#co_footnote_68" class="co_footnoteReference">68</a></sup> It focuses not on the nature of the work, but whether the author has either wholly or substantially reproduced a prior work.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_69"><a href="#co_footnote_69" class="co_footnoteReference">69</a></sup> The test betrays Britain’s industrialist past and its valuing of individual labour above intellectual pursuit. By focusing on individual effort and prohibiting unauthorised reproduction, it favours the enforcement interpretation over a qualitative approach to originality. Therefore, the "sweat of the brow" test for substantial originality in the UK appears to have functional equivalence to the "substantial reproduction" test. Such an approach seems out of harmony with the spirit of music-making, since reproduction of prior musical propositions appears to be at the core of Western composition. Further, a test of originality based on independent effort alone seems too broad, failing to address the importance of filtering out universal elements that are required to feed a "dynamic creative culture".<sup id="co_footnoteReference_70"><a href="#co_footnote_70" class="co_footnoteReference">70</a></sup> This test also seems to benefit creators by allowing "second-in-time" authors to escape liability for copyright infringement in music that may not be original or novel, if it can be proven that their work was merely coincidentally similar to a protected work.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_71"><a href="#co_footnote_71" class="co_footnoteReference">71</a></sup> </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The test that dominates civil legal systems sets a far higher threshold than its common law counterparts,<sup id="co_footnoteReference_72"><a href="#co_footnote_72" class="co_footnoteReference">72</a></sup> and demonstrates the very different philosophical stance that civil law courts take when awarding copyright to a work.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_73"><a href="#co_footnote_73" class="co_footnoteReference">73</a></sup> For example, an original work in France must reflect the author’s personality.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_74"><a href="#co_footnote_74" class="co_footnoteReference">74</a></sup> The German test goes further in requiring not only subjective individuality (<em>Individualität</em>), but also a minimal threshold of creativity (<em>Gestaltungshöhe</em>).<sup id="co_footnoteReference_75"><a href="#co_footnote_75" class="co_footnoteReference">75</a></sup> These tests are stricter, being necessarily subjective and requiring the mark of the author’s individual creativity.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_76"><a href="#co_footnote_76" class="co_footnoteReference">76</a></sup> The continental emphasis on artistic and intellectual creativity, compared with the sweat of the brow test favoured in British courts, ensures that uncertainty remains as to what precise elements are required for a finding of originality in musical works in civil law jurisdictions. <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S34E2F2309C0711E4ABBBADAAA4F7D653&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;73&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*73" />*E.I.P.R. 73</span>  </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Akin to the other jurisdictions examined here, "original" is not defined in the US statute, this task being left to the American courts.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_77"><a href="#co_footnote_77" class="co_footnoteReference">77</a></sup> The seminal case of  Feist Publications v Rural Telephone Service  (Feist) saw a departure from economic effort principles followed by other common law jurisdictions, bringing the US test for originality closer to civil law sentiments.

It appears then that a finding of originality in a later, similar or identical musical work operates primarily as a question of fact as to whether the author intended to reproduce the earlier work. When factoring in this element of intent to copy, the law must necessarily follow a highly subjective theory of originality by deciding whether the author of the secondary work had access to or knowledge of the earlier work.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_84"><a href="#co_footnote_84" class="co_footnoteReference">84</a></sup> However, when determining whether a "substantial part" of the earlier work has been copied, a court will direct its attention to the degree of originality via a qualitative and quantitative assessment of what has been taken.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_85"><a href="#co_footnote_85" class="co_footnoteReference">85</a></sup> It is here that the substantial originality test is relevant to musical works, since copyright subsistence in the plaintiff’s work is in issue.

The heavy focus on melody in the application of the substantial reproduction test by courts bolsters this. If the substantial originality test were applied to both songs in the first instance, then other distinctive musical elements could be uncovered, such as chord progressions, rhythm, structure, tonality and context. Drawing out the distinctive elements that gave each work its substantial originality under the substantial reproduction test is likely to have produced a very different outcome in the "Down Under" case. The original feature of "Kookaburra" was certainly its melody, but was this melody the same feature that rendered "Down Under" original? The flute melody in "Down Under", even in reproducing "Kookaburra", was a small part of the song’s overall arrangement, which contained other, distinct elements that made it an original composition before the flute riff was added. If the test for substantial reproduction had focused more on the distinctive parts of "Down Under", then despite the reproduction of the "Kookaburra" melody, evolutionary reproduction would not have collided with copyright to impinge on the originality of "Down Under". It remains now to ascertain how copyright could be reconciled with the realities of evolutionary composition to achieve an appropriate balance between authors’ rights and the public interest. </div> <div class="doc_division"><a id="co_anchor_21"></a><h2 class="co_headtext doc_headText">The capacity for reconciliation</h2><div class="co_paragraph"> "Originality is simply a fresh pair of eyes." Thomas Wentworth Higginson </div><div class="co_paragraph">  This article has portrayed Western music as a cyclic phenomenon. Yet this presents a conflict for the concept of the original work in copyright law. It has been shown that an original work must be at least the product of the author’s own labours and judgment or reflect the author’s unique personality and contain some "creative spark". A work cannot be original where it reproduces another.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_135"><a href="#co_footnote_135" class="co_footnoteReference">135</a></sup> Yet a corollary to the theory that all music is born out of at least one musical tradition is that reproduction is unavoidable. How then can the original musical work in copyright be reconciled with this reality? Where music in the fulfilment of its social purpose generates a co-dependency between creators and audiences, copyright should serve the interests of both sides. Where the legal concept of the original work fails to take account of commonality in music, it fails to balance the interests generated within this co-dependency. It is therefore questionable whether copyright serves the purpose of music when it hinges on an inflexible theory of originality. The following suggests approaches to assessing originality in copyright law that take account of music’s evolutionary characteristics. </div><h3 class="co_headtext"><i>A modified concept of originality</i></h3><div class="co_paragraph"> Considering the process of music creation expounded above, it is not surprising that courts are repeatedly faced with copyright infringement claims for musical works.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_136"><a href="#co_footnote_136" class="co_footnoteReference">136</a></sup> The "substantial reproduction" approach to originality for musical works is limited—both in its failure to justify the originality taken for granted in the plaintiff’s work and to give adequate weight to distinguishing elements in the defendant’s work. A presumption of originality allows right holders to arbitrarily enforce copyright against similar musical expression that may not be appropriate in every case. If greater analysis were directed at whether the plaintiff’s musical work was sufficiently original to proffer a legally enforceable proprietary right, or whether the defendant’s work was sufficiently distinctive notwithstanding the unauthorised reproduction, then perhaps the number of infringement allegations could be drastically reduced. For this to occur, the "substantial originality" test must account for commonality in musical works. Furthermore, this modified approach to originality must be fused to the "substantial reproduction" test to ensure its application in infringement disputes concerning musical works, rather than merely in disputes concerning generic, utilitarian works. This has in some sense been achieved under the British "substantial originality" test. Therefore, the principal focus for reform lies in acknowledging the collective nature of composition with further emphasis on distinguishing features rather than similarities of musical expression. </div><h3 class="co_headtext">Context as a distinguishing factor</h3><div class="co_paragraph"> The impact of context on how the listener receives music presents one avenue for reform. This approach is inferred in  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/ICA23C4C0BD0911DDB366A7A3A710BD7B/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">D’Almaine v Boosey</a> , where emphasis must be given to "whether the air taken is substantially the same with the original".<sup id="co_footnoteReference_137"><a href="#co_footnote_137" class="co_footnoteReference">137</a></sup> Although context did not receive much attention during deliberation on this principle in  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/IA9036380E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Francis Day</a> , it was the incidental focus of some analysis in the "Down Under" case.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_138"><a href="#co_footnote_138" class="co_footnoteReference">138</a></sup> However, Jacobson J’s heavy <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S34E2F2309C0711E4ABBBADAAA4F7D653&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;79&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*79" />*E.I.P.R. 79</span>  emphasis on the melodic identity between the shared phrases in the "Down Under" case appears to have significantly narrowed the application of this principle. It is arguable that despite the melodic identity between the two works, the "air" taken from "Kookaburra" was altered enough in feel, harmony, rhythm and genre to place it within a significantly distinct context from the original.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_139"><a href="#co_footnote_139" class="co_footnoteReference">139</a></sup> The harmonic changes that altered the original melody’s mood from "jolly or observational" to "whimsical or wistful"<sup id="co_footnoteReference_140"><a href="#co_footnote_140" class="co_footnoteReference">140</a></sup> and its treatment in a reggae-beat pop song instead of a 4/4 children’s nursery rhyme markedly differentiate it from the original "Kookaburra" work. Yet, the distinctive elements of "Down Under" stood no chance against the inflexible "substantial reproduction" test. If distinguishing factors like context were appreciated in originality analysis, the tests could enjoy much-needed flexibility towards recognising our cross-pollinating music culture. </div><h3 class="co_headtext">A dynamic originality standard</h3><div class="co_paragraph"> Since the threshold of originality in a musical work appears to exist at the equivocal point at which musical ideas are "expressed", a scaled originality standard could ground copyright in musical works more accurately. At the lower end of the spectrum, a standard based merely on industriousness in seeking only that a work not reproduce another tips the scale in favour of first-in-time right holders, to the detriment of the public interest in maintaining a healthy public domain that furthers creative innovation. At the higher end of the spectrum, a standard that allows for reproduction and recycling in music, but distinguishes this on grounds of authorial creativity and contextual distinctions, would better balance the policy scale. It could support both the public domain and rights holders by allowing creators to produce "original" works that draw from and build upon the works of others. Where this scale should rest must be determined on a case-by-case basis; the lower the standard applicable, the less strictly the author should be allowed to enforce his or her rights in the work. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> A single, dynamic standard based on creative choices of the author would depend on the category of the work.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_141"><a href="#co_footnote_141" class="co_footnoteReference">141</a></sup> In utilitarian works, choices based on functionality, efficiency or applicable standards and practices are excluded, whereas choices in artistic works are those which reflect the author’s personality. This offers a standard that can shift to accommodate creative or technological developments as well as "local" factors that impact on the criterion of originality, such as time, place, context and audience familiarity with the work.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_142"><a href="#co_footnote_142" class="co_footnoteReference">142</a></sup> A "creative choices" originality standard appears to readily accommodate evolutionary musical practices.

It is not stated whether these phrases were commonplace by reason of the folk songs being out of copyright, or because they used <em>scènes à faire</em> compositional techniques.

An inflexible view of copyright subsistence in musical works muzzles musical expression that belongs to an ever-evolving compositional cycle. This problem is reflected in the saying "Where there’s a hit there’s a writ".<sup id="co_footnoteReference_150"><a href="#co_footnote_150" class="co_footnoteReference">150</a></sup> To ensure that creators are in a position to draw from the musical canon without infringing copyright, the concept of an original work in copyright law and the circumstances in which right holders can enforce their exclusive rights must be reformed. Current legal tests for copyright subsistence are too blunt to unequivocally accord originality to musical works in an atmosphere where much of musical expression feeds off its creative environment. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The substantial originality test must recognise commonplace elements in music, and this test must be triggered by musical works, rather than merely utilitarian works. In addition to scrutinising the originality of the plaintiff’s musical work in infringement disputes, the elements that render the defendant’s work original must be given greater weight in the comparative analysis of shared musical phrases. This is achieved to some extent under the "substantial reproduction" test, but this test fails to recognise the inevitability of reproduction in music and causal connections between musical works in today’s global society.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_151"><a href="#co_footnote_151" class="co_footnoteReference">151</a></sup> What constitutes an "original work" in copyright law must in every case be qualified by music’s cross-pollinating nature. Nevertheless, the importance of copyright and its aptitude for wealth creation in society cannot be discounted. Copyright has been rightly described as "the currency in which all sectors of the [music] industry trade".<sup id="co_footnoteReference_152"><a href="#co_footnote_152" class="co_footnoteReference">152</a></sup> Yet rewarding individuals with exclusive rights at the expense of collective creativity is counterintuitive, as evidenced in the vulnerability of popular music to legal attack. Many societies have accepted that music does not originate with the individual alone,<sup id="co_footnoteReference_153"><a href="#co_footnote_153" class="co_footnoteReference">153</a></sup> and so must copyright law acknowledge this viewpoint. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> So, who really owns music? The answer must be—everyone and no one. This paradox reflects the opposing policy interests in copyright law between authors and the community, which must be at the forefront of any determination of the point at which musical expression can be given the stamp of originality. If much of musical expression is a co-operative endeavour, then "originality is simply a fresh pair of eyes".<sup id="co_footnoteReference_154"><a href="#co_footnote_154" class="co_footnoteReference">154</a></sup> To allow copyright to thrive equitably, the originality requirement must be applied to the musical work in a manner that more accurately reflects the reality of collective, evolutionary creativity. Failing this, we are left with a flawed interpretation of originality, only worthy of awarding copyright to works created in a cultural vacuum (or created by "Adam and Eve" even!).

"sister" subsidiaries may not form a fiscal unity without the parent company. However, the Advocate General and the CJEU rejected these arguments. The disadvantage stemmed from the prohibition on including any non-Dutch entities in a fiscal unity. On 1., the key point was that a Dutch parent company with only Dutch subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries would have the option of entering into a fiscal unity, even if it chose not to, whereas a Dutch parent with non-Dutch intermediate subsidiaries would not have that opportunity. On 2., a Dutch parent could form a fiscal unity with its Dutch subsidiaries, but a non-Dutch parent could not. </div> <a id="co_anchor_8"></a><h2 class="co_headtext">Justifications for breach of freedom of establishment?</h2><div class="co_paragraph"> A prima facie restriction on freedom of establishment can nevertheless be justified under EU law by an "overriding reason in the public interest",<sup id="co_footnoteReference_21"><a href="#co_footnote_21" class="co_footnoteReference">21</a></sup> provided that its application is appropriate and proportionate in light of the objective to be achieved. The Netherlands argued, in defence of the fiscal unity rules, first that they were necessary to preserve the coherence of the domestic tax system including preventing the double use of losses, and secondly that they prevented tax avoidance. The CJEU swiftly dispensed with the second possible ground of defence, on the basis that  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/IFA29CD30492611DBB7D2DABB29C96E01/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem"> Cadbury Schweppes plc v IRC </a> <sup id="co_footnoteReference_22"><a href="#co_footnote_22" class="co_footnoteReference">22</a></sup> is authority for the premise that preventing tax avoidance does not of itself justify a restriction on freedom of establishment  </div><div class="co_paragraph"> "if it is not relied on in conjunction with a specific objective of combatting wholly artificial arrangements which do not reflect economic reality and the purpose of which is to escape the tax normally due. <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S4DD732107BA011E49E919D7445422692&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;534&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*534" />*B.T.R. 534</span> "<sup id="co_footnoteReference_23"><a href="#co_footnote_23" class="co_footnoteReference">23</a></sup> </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The other concern raised by the Netherlands was that the losses of a Dutch sub-subsidiary that is a member of a fiscal unity with a Dutch parent could be double counted, and that such double counting would harm the coherence of its tax system. The Netherlands argued, first, that the loss could be used at the parent level by way of the consolidation of profits and losses across the fiscal unity. Secondly, a loss could also be claimed because of a reduction in the value of the shares in the sub-subsidiary held by the non-Dutch intermediate company.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_24"><a href="#co_footnote_24" class="co_footnoteReference">24</a></sup> However, the Netherlands has a "holding exemption" that essentially ignores, for most tax purposes,<sup id="co_footnoteReference_25"><a href="#co_footnote_25" class="co_footnoteReference">25</a></sup> gains or losses from the possession, acquisition or disposal of a shareholding greater than 5 per cent in another company.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_26"><a href="#co_footnote_26" class="co_footnoteReference">26</a></sup> A Netherlands fiscal unity requires, among other things, ownership by the parent of at least 95 per cent of the shares in a relevant subsidiary. Therefore, the holding exemption should apply to any shareholding of a parent in respect of a subsidiary, but crucially, this exemption applies whether or not a fiscal unity has been created with that subsidiary. The CJEU found that there was no "direct link" under Netherlands law between the tax benefits of fiscal unity status and the disallowance of gains and losses in respect of a shareholding in a subsidiary. Without such a "direct link" the justification based on reserving the coherence of the tax system does not apply. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The existence and operation of this participation exemption distinguished the Joined Cases<sup id="co_footnoteReference_27"><a href="#co_footnote_27" class="co_footnoteReference">27</a></sup> from  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/I1F9EC810023711DE85D4E88FA426F44D/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Papillon</a> ,<sup id="co_footnoteReference_28"><a href="#co_footnote_28" class="co_footnoteReference">28</a></sup> which concerned the French tax grouping rules.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_29"><a href="#co_footnote_29" class="co_footnoteReference">29</a></sup> In that case, France argued that the rule preventing a French-resident parent company and French-resident sub-subsidiaries from forming a group via a non-French intermediate company was necessary to avoid the double use of losses (that is, first by the losses being transferred within the tax group, and secondly as a deductible loss in respect of the loss-making company’s shares in the hands of its non-French parent). To combat such a double use of losses, the French rules provided for the "neutralisation" of certain transactions intra-group where all group members were French and all intermediate companies were French. However, the potential double use of losses would not be prevented by the French rules where a non-French-resident subsidiary was interposed between the French parent and the French sub-subsidiary, because the non-French-resident intermediate subsidiary was not subject to those neutralisation rules. <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S4DD732107BA011E49E919D7445422692&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;535&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*535" />*B.T.R. 535</span> <sup id="co_footnoteReference_30"><a href="#co_footnote_30" class="co_footnoteReference">30</a></sup> </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Preventing a grouping relationship because of the presence of a non-French-resident intermediate subsidiary within the ownership chain was a restriction on freedom of establishment. For this to be justified on the ground of preserving the coherence of the tax system, France needed to show that there was a "direct link" between the tax grouping regime and the neutralisation of intra-group transactions. The CJEU accepted that there was such a link. However, departing from Advocate General Kokott’s Opinion,<sup id="co_footnoteReference_31"><a href="#co_footnote_31" class="co_footnoteReference">31</a></sup> it held that the French grouping rules still went beyond what was strictly necessary to preserve the coherence of the tax system. On the basis that there were less restrictive measures to ensure that losses were not utilised twice, the CJEU in  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/I1F9EC810023711DE85D4E88FA426F44D/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Papillon</a> ,<sup id="co_footnoteReference_32"><a href="#co_footnote_32" class="co_footnoteReference">32</a></sup> found the French grouping rules incompatible with EU law. In the Joined Cases,<sup id="co_footnoteReference_33"><a href="#co_footnote_33" class="co_footnoteReference">33</a></sup> Advocate General Kokott’s analysis was similar. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> By contrast, the CJEU simply held in the Joined Cases<sup id="co_footnoteReference_34"><a href="#co_footnote_34" class="co_footnoteReference">34</a></sup> that there was no "direct link" established between the granting of the tax advantage (that is, participation in a Dutch fiscal unity) and the non-recognition of gains or losses in respect of shares in a subsidiary because of the holding exemption discussed above. Therefore the restrictions in the Netherlands fiscal unity regime could not be justified by an argument that the status quo was necessary to maintain the coherence of the national tax system. The CJEU also ruled that the justifications claimed were not enough to validate refusing fiscal unity status to Dutch-taxpaying sister subsidiaries of a German parent company in the case of  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/I81D23520401711E49A0DCA6D76E2AC4E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">X</a> .<sup id="co_footnoteReference_35"><a href="#co_footnote_35" class="co_footnoteReference">35</a></sup> </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Since the Netherlands failed to demonstrate adequate justification for the restriction on freedom of establishment caused by its fiscal unity regime, the Netherlands rules were found to be in breach of EU law. </div> <a id="co_anchor_9"></a><h2 class="co_headtext">Comment</h2><div class="co_paragraph"> Tax consolidation affords groups of companies considerable simplification of their tax affairs in a particular jurisdiction, for example by allowing them to disregard intra-group transfers, and to aggregate profits and losses on a group-wide basis.

However, that rule change did not permit grouping of French "sister" subsidiaries of a foreign parent. In response to the decision in the Joined Cases, the French Parliament is currently considering a legislative change that would allow the grouping of French "sister" subsidiaries of a parent company located in an EU Member State, or a Member State of the EEA, that has entered into a tax treaty with France providing for administrative assistance.

"sister" subsidiaries may not form a fiscal unity without the parent company. However, the Advocate General and the CJEU rejected these arguments. The disadvantage stemmed from the prohibition on including any non-Dutch entities in a fiscal unity. On 1., the key point was that a Dutch parent company with only Dutch subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries would have the option of entering into a fiscal unity, even if it chose not to, whereas a Dutch parent with non-Dutch intermediate subsidiaries would not have that opportunity.

The Netherlands argued, first, that the loss could be used at the parent level by way of the consolidation of profits and losses across the fiscal unity. Secondly, a loss could also be claimed because of a reduction in the value of the shares in the sub-subsidiary held by the non-Dutch intermediate company.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_24"><a href="#co_footnote_24" class="co_footnoteReference">24</a></sup> However, the Netherlands has a "holding exemption" that essentially ignores, for most tax purposes,<sup id="co_footnoteReference_25"><a href="#co_footnote_25" class="co_footnoteReference">25</a></sup> gains or losses from the possession, acquisition or disposal of a shareholding greater than 5 per cent in another company.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_26"><a href="#co_footnote_26" class="co_footnoteReference">26</a></sup> A Netherlands fiscal unity requires, among other things, ownership by the parent of at least 95 per cent of the shares in a relevant subsidiary. Therefore, the holding exemption should apply to any shareholding of a parent in respect of a subsidiary, but crucially, this exemption applies whether or not a fiscal unity has been created with that subsidiary. The CJEU found that there was no "direct link" under Netherlands law between the tax benefits of fiscal unity status and the disallowance of gains and losses in respect of a shareholding in a subsidiary.

To combat such a double use of losses, the French rules provided for the "neutralisation" of certain transactions intra-group where all group members were French and all intermediate companies were French. However, the potential double use of losses would not be prevented by the French rules where a non-French-resident subsidiary was interposed between the French parent and the French sub-subsidiary, because the non-French-resident intermediate subsidiary was not subject to those neutralisation rules. <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S4DD732107BA011E49E919D7445422692&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;535&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*535" />*B.T.R. 535</span> <sup id="co_footnoteReference_30"><a href="#co_footnote_30" class="co_footnoteReference">30</a></sup> </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Preventing a grouping relationship because of the presence of a non-French-resident intermediate subsidiary within the ownership chain was a restriction on freedom of establishment.

On the basis that there were less restrictive measures to ensure that losses were not utilised twice, the CJEU in  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/I1F9EC810023711DE85D4E88FA426F44D/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Papillon</a> ,<sup id="co_footnoteReference_32"><a href="#co_footnote_32" class="co_footnoteReference">32</a></sup> found the French grouping rules incompatible with EU law. In the Joined Cases,<sup id="co_footnoteReference_33"><a href="#co_footnote_33" class="co_footnoteReference">33</a></sup> Advocate General Kokott’s analysis was similar. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> By contrast, the CJEU simply held in the Joined Cases<sup id="co_footnoteReference_34"><a href="#co_footnote_34" class="co_footnoteReference">34</a></sup> that there was no "direct link" established between the granting of the tax advantage (that is, participation in a Dutch fiscal unity) and the non-recognition of gains or losses in respect of shares in a subsidiary because of the holding exemption discussed above. Therefore the restrictions in the Netherlands fiscal unity regime could not be justified by an argument that the status quo was necessary to maintain the coherence of the national tax system. The CJEU also ruled that the justifications claimed were not enough to validate refusing fiscal unity status to Dutch-taxpaying sister subsidiaries of a German parent company in the case of  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/I81D23520401711E49A0DCA6D76E2AC4E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">X</a> .<sup id="co_footnoteReference_35"><a href="#co_footnote_35" class="co_footnoteReference">35</a></sup> </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Since the Netherlands failed to demonstrate adequate justification for the restriction on freedom of establishment caused by its fiscal unity regime, the Netherlands rules were found to be in breach of EU law. </div></div> <div class="doc_division"><a id="co_anchor_9"></a><h2 class="co_headtext doc_headText">Comment</h2><div class="co_paragraph"> Tax consolidation affords groups of companies considerable simplification of their tax affairs in a particular jurisdiction, for example by allowing them to disregard intra-group transfers, and to aggregate profits and losses on a group-wide basis. It is good news for taxpayers that groups for tax consolidation purposes can be traced through non-resident EEA companies in the group, whether these non-resident companies are intermediate subsidiaries or the group parent itself. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Together with the  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/I1F9EC810023711DE85D4E88FA426F44D/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Papillon</a> <sup id="co_footnoteReference_36"><a href="#co_footnote_36" class="co_footnoteReference">36</a></sup> decision, the Joined Cases<sup id="co_footnoteReference_37"><a href="#co_footnote_37" class="co_footnoteReference">37</a></sup> illustrate that it seems to be a settled principle of EU law that Member States are not permitted to restrict group tax consolidation because parent entities or intermediate entities are established in another Member State. It also appears that this principle applies regardless of the precise mechanics of tax consolidation in a Member State. Given the decision in the Joined Cases,<sup id="co_footnoteReference_38"><a href="#co_footnote_38" class="co_footnoteReference">38</a></sup> it would be surprising if further reform of Member States’ tax grouping rules were not precipitated. For example, the French grouping <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S4DD732107BA011E49E919D7445422692&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;536&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*536" />*B.T.R. 536</span>  rules were amended in 2009 in light of the  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/I1F9EC810023711DE85D4E88FA426F44D/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Papillon</a> <sup id="co_footnoteReference_39"><a href="#co_footnote_39" class="co_footnoteReference">39</a></sup> decision, to allow grouping between a French parent and French sub-subsidiaries owned via a non-French EEA intermediate company. However, that rule change did not permit grouping of French "sister" subsidiaries of a foreign parent. In response to the decision in the Joined Cases, the French Parliament is currently considering a legislative change that would allow the grouping of French "sister" subsidiaries of a parent company located in an EU Member State, or a Member State of the EEA, that has entered into a tax treaty with France providing for administrative assistance. Arguably, this change would be the minimum necessary to bring the French regime in line with EU law. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The Joined Cases<sup id="co_footnoteReference_40"><a href="#co_footnote_40" class="co_footnoteReference">40</a></sup> are also a helpful reminder that preventing tax avoidance is not a catch-all justification for restricting fundamental TFEU freedoms, and that Member States cannot always rely on "preserving the coherence of the tax system" to justify such restrictions. In fact, Member States have historically had limited success justifying infringement of EU fundamental freedoms on the basis of protecting the "coherence of the tax system", a justification first articulated by the European Court of Justice in  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/I6D6DA290E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Bachmann v Belgian State</a> .<sup id="co_footnoteReference_41"><a href="#co_footnote_41" class="co_footnoteReference">41</a></sup> </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In light of the CJEU jurisprudence in  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/I1F9EC810023711DE85D4E88FA426F44D/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Papillon</a> <sup id="co_footnoteReference_42"><a href="#co_footnote_42" class="co_footnoteReference">42</a></sup> and the Joined Cases<sup id="co_footnoteReference_43"><a href="#co_footnote_43" class="co_footnoteReference">43</a></sup> other Member States such as the Netherlands may consider allowing tax consolidation of companies resident in a Member State where parent entities or intermediate entities are established outside the EEA. This would go beyond what is strictly necessary to comply with freedom of establishment under EU law and the proposals currently being considered by the French Parliament do not take such an expansive approach. However, the UK took such an approach in response to  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/IC5DD40C0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Imperial Chemical Industries plc v Colmer</a>  ( <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/IC5DD40C0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Colmer</a> ),<sup id="co_footnoteReference_44"><a href="#co_footnote_44" class="co_footnoteReference">44</a></sup> when it enacted changes to its direct tax grouping rules.

In short, the UK went some way beyond what the  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/IC5DD40C0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Colmer</a> <sup id="co_footnoteReference_45"><a href="#co_footnote_45" class="co_footnoteReference">45</a></sup> decision strictly required.

Barriers to entry, however, may surface, which usually represent one of three kinds: legal, economic or strategic. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Legal barriers refer, for example, to public regulation preventing the entry of new domestic or foreign banking institutions to a new banking market. However, in the common market, most of the legal barriers to the expansion of banks' operations to the other E.U. countries have been removed. In Finland, foreign banks face no legal barriers whatsoever to market entry. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Economic (or business-related) entry barriers refer to various business difficulties that foreign banks may face in the new market which may ultimately totally block their entry. In the banking industry, economic barriers may include high investment costs and the absence of economies of scale or economies of scope. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The competition authorities, however, have focused their energies on strategic entry barriers caused by the activities of the banks already operating in the markets. Today, the strategic barriers are increasingly related to different electronic banking services provided through various kinds of electronic banking networks. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The competition authorities should be concerned about these electronic banking services and networks, particularly when (a) the networks are being formed as joint ventures of several competing banks, or (b) the founders of the networks are unwilling, by joint agreement, to allow the entry of new competing banking institutions into them (so-called “network blocking”). </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Even though these situations should trigger the <em>interest</em> of the competition authorities, it does not necessarily mean that the establishment of joint ventures or even network blocking would be in conflict with workable competition. However, in order to tackle these situations, the competition authorities may first have to decide how far-reaching co-operation in the building of banking networks should be, in view of workable competition, and what are the efficiency arguments for the co-operation. Secondly, a critical look should be taken as to why new competitiors should be able to enter the networks in the first place, or whether they should simply start developing their own electronic banking services on a par with their competitors. The present article reviews some Finnish cases touching the issue. </div> <a id="co_anchor_3"></a><h2 class="co_headtext">Importance of Electronic Banking</h2><div class="co_paragraph"> Electronic banking may consist of many different banking services. Here, the author concentrates on the most common: payment services (such as bill payments or fund transfers) and different payment card services. The term <em>electronic</em> banking services derives from the way they are distributed to banking customers, <em>i.e.</em> through ATMs, the Internet, PCs and tele-banking links. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In Finland, the electronic development of the banking industry has been rapid. The number of electronic links between banks and their customers has increased sevenfold during the 1990s. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> For instance, of all Finnish corporate customers, some 80 per cent already manage their banking transactions with a direct electronic data link to their bank. On the other hand, the great majority of private customers' bill payments and other fund transfers are handled through giro ATMs, direct debiting or via the Internet. The use of the Internet, in particular, in banking services is rapidly growing, as nowadays almost every Finnish bank offers bill payments via the Internet. This is one reason why an estimated one quarter of the adult population handles the bulk of their banking business solely via the Internet. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The importance of electronic banking in the country is further attested by the fact that the use of ATMs in Finland is among the highest of the E.U. countries, when adjusted to population (see table). </div> <a id="co_anchor_4"></a><h2 class="co_headtext">Table 1: ATM transactions in the E.U. 1996</h2> <table style="width:100%;"> <tr valign="top"> <th class="co_hAlign2 co_vAlign3"></th> <th class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">No. per head</th> <th class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Total (in millions)</th> <th class="co_hAlign2 co_vAlign3">Per ATM per month</th> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Finland</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">44</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">218</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">7,888</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Sweden</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">32</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">285</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">9,960</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Netherlands</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">27</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">416</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">5,948</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">U.K.</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">25</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">1,452</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">5,492</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Ireland</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">24</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">84</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">7,050</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Portugal</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">22</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">212</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">3,262</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Denmark</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">21</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">110</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">4,011</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">France</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">19</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">1,102</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">3,735</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Austria</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">17</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">134</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">2,709</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Spain</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">16</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">649</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">1,812</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Belgium</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">15</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">156</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">3,044</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Germany</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">15</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">1,190</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">2,548</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Italy</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">9</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">522</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">1,634</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Greece</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">6</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">58</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">2,418</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Luxembourg</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">n/a</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3"></td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3"></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="4" class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Source: European Card Review, May-June 1997</td> </tr> </table>  <div class="co_paragraph">    <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S0396C9D0E74E11DAB6EDAFAEBAD7D114&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;360&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*360" />*J.I.B.L. 360</span>  In fact, the electronic development of the banking industry has advanced so quickly in Finland that, according to a survey conducted by the Bank of Finland, the rate of electronicisation of the payment systems between banks and their customers in Finland tops the whole of the E.U. According to the same survey, Finland will also continue to be a pioneer in the development of the field. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> As Finnish banking customers have quickly adopted the use of electronic banking services, it may not necessarily be possible for a foreign bank to succeed in the Finnish banking business without offering high-level electronic banking service networks to its Finnish customers. For this reason, potential network blocking issues have been central in the application of competition policy to the country's banking industry. </div> <a id="co_anchor_5"></a><h2 class="co_headtext">Co-operation</h2><div class="co_paragraph"> In a country such as Finland, which is sparsely populated and has a fairly small number of residents, it has been a rational choice for several incumbent banks to jointly build the basic infrastructure for electronic banking services. On the other hand, maintaining the infrastructure is also likely to be costly: a further incentive for co-operation. Economies of scale are often related to electronic banking services, <em>i.e.</em> the higher the number of banks whose transactions the clearing system process, the lower the costs of individual transactions, which clearly benefits those banks that are members of the clearing system. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In addition to cost benefits, in some cases, the banks' co-operation has also made it possible to develop increasingly sophisticated service applications for customers. Thus, co-operation may have effects which increase the dynamic efficiency of the market. But in spite of the potential positive effects of cooperation among the incumbent banks, co-operation can create market power and entry barriers too. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Problems may arise primarily because the new foreign banks seeking entry may have some well-grounded business or legal (antitrust) motives to obtain access to the already existing electronic banking systems, particularly if building or maintaining a parallel electronic banking network on their own will be non-profitable due to the competition with the incumbent banks' joint venture, where the (sunk or operating) costs can be jointly shared by a number of banks. Foreign banks do not necessarily--alone or together--have the same economic opportunities to create their own electronic banking system, which would, either in scope or volume of use, correspond to the capacity of the joint networks of the traditional, incumbent banks. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Since co-operation in different electronic banking joint venture systems frequently creates economies of scale and hence significant cost benefits, blocking access to the joint venture may act as an entry barrier to new competitors, unless they are able to join in the same cost-saving collaboration. This can mean that, unless foreign banks are able to join the incumbent banks' collaboration on electronic banking services, they may not be able to offer some of their banking services in a sufficiently cost-effective manner in Finland. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> However, the competition authorities must be cautious in their network blocking decisions not to allow free riders and not unduly to weaken the banks' motivation to further develop their operations. The main question, therefore, is which banking networks can be considered essential for their existence in the Finnish banking market, and on what terms the new entrants should be able to join the existing networks. There follows a review of topical Finnish cases. </div> <a id="co_anchor_6"></a><h2 class="co_headtext">Case Law in Finland</h2><div class="co_paragraph">   </div> <h3 class="co_headtext">Automatia ATM Ltd (1995)</h3><div class="co_paragraph"> Merita Bank, Okobank Group Central Cooperative Bank and Leonia Bank Ltd (formerly Postipankki Ltd) are the three largest banks in Finland. The joint market share of these banks of banking services to household customers is around 90 per cent. In 1994, these banks set up a co-operative joint venture for the administering and running of the daily operations of their ATMs. All the cash dispensing ATMs of the member banks were made subject to the company Automatia ATM Ltd. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The banks applied for an exemption to their cooperation from the Finnish Competition Authority, as they had agreed on interbank fees in order to compensate the use of jointly run ATMs to each other. Additionally, the member banks had agreed not to compete with Automatia in the cash dispensing ATM services. In practice, this led to the forming of one cash dispensing ATM chain operating under a common brand from three competing cash dispensing ATM networks. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The founding of the joint venture was supported by the cost savings (cost efficiencies) resulting from the joint maintenance of the machines. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The Finnish Competition Authority approved the operations of the co-operative joint venture set up for the joint administering of the cash dispensing ATMs. However, in its decision, the Authority emphasised that the joint use of the ATMs benefits customers only if each bank participating in the joint use independently decides on the fees to be collected from its own customers. The member banks agreed to the terms set by the Authority and the exemption was granted till the end of 2005. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Now that three years have passed since the decision, it can be estimated that the approval of the Automatia co-operation has increased the cost efficiency of Finnish ATM services. The co-operation has evidently benefited banking customers, too, precisely because, in spite of the Automatia co-operation, the member banks must independently price the  <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S0396C9D0E74E11DAB6EDAFAEBAD7D114&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;361&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*361" />*J.I.B.L. 361</span>  ATM fees they collect from their customers. This means that the member banks continuously compete with each other, price included, thus fulfilling the basic requirement that the cost efficiency of the Automatia co-operation must also benefit member banks' customers. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Even now, as prior to the exemption application, the Automatia ATM joint venture covers about 90 per cent of all the cash dispensing ATMs used in the country. However, no competing (<em>e.g.</em> foreign) banking institutions or other enterprises have yet sought entry to it. Should this happen, the Authority would have to investigate whether cash withdrawals from the ATMs should be defined as a relevant market of their own. The present member banks of the Automatia joint venture would be likely to point out then that cash withdrawals are now possible even from some retail store counters, so that customers have access to other cash distributing channels than ATMs. The network entrants would probably not share this view. Hence, market definition will always be the key question even in network blocking cases. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In this respect, it is interesting to make a comparison with a famous Texas antitrust case on cash dispensing ATMs and its market definition, in particular. In this famous Pulse arbitration, Professor Kauper namely rejected the proposed markets of “all payment systems” and “all means of obtaining cash” and identified instead a narrow retail market of “ATM services”, on the grounds that “there is [in Texas] a significant group of ATM users who value the characteristics of ATMs and for whom other means of obtaining cash are not reasonable substitutes”. He thus concluded that “ATMs are themselves a relevant, if fragile, market for antitrust purposes”. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In Canada, too, the competition authorities have taken a stand on the position of ATM networks from a competition law viewpoint. Interac, the most extensive cash dispensing ATM network in Canada, was originally controlled by nine major Canadian banks, trust companies and credit union societies. These institutions jointly controlled the Interac network, which allowed customers to use banking cards to withdraw cash from ATMs bearing an Interac logo. In the consent order given by the Canadian Competition Tribunal in 1996, Interac was found to be in a dominant position as the provider of ATM services and was obliged to operate as a non-profit corporation. Interac had to open up its network to all other potential deposit-taking financial institutions on a non-discriminatory basis. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In addition to market definition, these two cases display the other important feature involved in network blocking cases: the number of substitutes in the different banking markets can vary from each other. The basic reason for this is that, in the banking industry, the level of technical development and therefore the “demand culture” often differs from one country to another (and from one market to another). </div> <h3 class="co_headtext">Merita Bank v. Handelsbanken (1996)</h3><div class="co_paragraph"> One of the new active entrants in the Finnish banking market is the Swedish-owned bank Svenska Handelsbanken. Although its market share is still less than 5 per cent, it has steadily increased its share both among Finnish corporate and household customers. Merita Bank, on the other hand, is in many ways Finland's largest bank. It has, for example, around three million private customers in Finland (out of Finland's population of five million). Furthermore, the bank itself estimates that some 60 per cent of the country's small and medium-sized enterprises use Merita Bank's services as their first choice. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Customers can pay their bills and transfer funds from their bank accounts, for instance, via the giro ATMs. Two years ago, Svenska Handelsbanken inquired from the Finnish Competition Authority whether the giro ATM network should be considered essential for foreign banks' businesses and whether Merita Bank should provide open access to its own giro ATM network. Thus Svenska Handelsbanken called into question whether Merita might reserve the giro ATMs for its own customers only. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The case was interesting in at least two ways. First, at the time the case was opened, Merita controlled about 60 per cent of all the giro ATMs in the country. Secondly, in Finland, giro ATMs are one of the major fund transfer channels, as around 40 per cent of private customers conduct all their payment transfers via the giro ATMs. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The Finnish Competition Authority, however, held that Merita had no obligation to allow other banks access to the giro ATM network it had built for its own customers. The primary grounds included the lack of indication why Svenska Handelsbanken could not organise the provision of giro services on its own via other distribution channels. The Authority referred to direct debiting, telephone banking possibilities and PC connections (the Internet included) as such alternative distribution channels. In other words, by its market definition, the Authority demonstrated that, in the case in question, entry into Merita Bank's giro ATM network was not essential for the operations of the foreign bank. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In addition to alternative distribution channels, it was not shown why Svenska Handelsbanken could not build a competing giro ATM network itself for the regions in which it operates in Finland. Since Svenska Handelsbanken was already able to compete with Merita in payment transfer, the promotion of competition did not require Merita to allow Svenska Handelsbanken access to its giro ATM network. The Authority did not directly refer to free-riding, but this clearly was one of the background issues. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Looking back, it is even harder now to argue for a different kind of decision by the Authority, particularly because Internet payments, for instance, have dramatically increased their popularity among household customers. To take Merita Bank itself as an example, of its three million private customers, already some 450,000 own a password to the bank's  <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S0396C9D0E74E11DAB6EDAFAEBAD7D114&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;362&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*362" />*J.I.B.L. 362</span>  Internet payment services. There is no reason to believe that the proportion of Internet customers in other Finnish banks would greatly differ from Merita's figures. The Internet payment services are thus a genuine alternative distribution channel for the giro ATMs. </div> <h3 class="co_headtext">Automatia cashcards (1997)</h3><div class="co_paragraph"> In June 1996, the Finnish Competition Authority received an exemption application for co-operation within the electronic cash (or electronic purse) system from Merita Bank, Okobank Group Central Cooperative and Leonia (Postipankki) (the “member banks”) who had set up a company called Automatia Electronic Purse Ltd (see Figure 1). </div><div class="co_paragraph co_imageResearch"> <span class="co_nonDisplayableImage">Tabular or graphic material set at this point is not displayable.</span> </div><span class="co_docFigureDescription"></span><div class="co_paragraph"> The Avant electronic cash system which the company represents is based on two types of cashcards: reloadable and disposable cashcards. Both types of cards are used identically for paying for a wide variety of services, <em>e.g.</em> payphones, parking, public transport, municipal services, canteens, kiosks and shops. All payment transactions with the Avant electronic cashcard are anonymous. The key idea of the electronic purse is to replace hard cash (coins) and to diminish the costs caused by the use of coins. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In its decision on the exemption application, the Finnish Competition Authority held that the cooperation between the member banks within the electronic cash system promotes the entry of new means of payment into the markets and the technical development of the field. The co-operation eliminates the duplication of costs, thus increasing economic efficiency. An extensive electronic cash system and the possibility of using a new method of payment, replacing hard cash, benefits customers and consumers. The cost savings may be considerable, as in Finland around 80 per cent of household payments are paid by cash, and cash payments are, in general, a more expensive payment method for the economy  <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S0396C9D0E74E11DAB6EDAFAEBAD7D114&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;363&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*363" />*J.I.B.L. 363</span>  compared to different kinds of on-line payment card transactions. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> According to Automatia, all credit institutions which are part of the Finnish interbank clearing system can join in the electronic cash system as the issuers of reloadable Avant smart cards. However, an entry fee and an annual fee will be collected from credit institutions joining the electronic cashcard system; these fees will be jointly determined by the member banks. The Finnish Competition Authority found that this price co-operation violated the prohibition of Article 6 of the Competition Act. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In the system, customers are able to reload their electronic purse cards at the ATMs directly from their personal bank accounts. According to the exemption application, Automatia collects a reload charge from electronic cashcard customers jointly set by the member banks. However, the Authority found that price co-operation on the member banks' reload charges would severely restrict the electronic cashcard customers' possibilities for tendering different banks in the electronic cashcard system, and held that no exemption is granted to the price collaboration on the member banks' reloading and unloading services. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> On the other hand, the Authority found that price collaboration on retailer commissions is justified at the early stages of the system because it decreases the negotiating costs related to the marketing of the new cashcard and because it is to be expected that the resulting efficiency benefits will primarily accrue to the customers and the consumers. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Furthermore, the member banks had agreed that they would not act in co-operation with other electronic cashcard systems possibly competing with Automatia. The Finnish Competition Authority required that the member banks dissolve this noncompetition clause by December 31, 1997, so that it will not prevent the member banks from joining cashcard transactions to various memory, function and smart card operations, and that the member banks continue to have the incentive to further develop their own reloading services of cashcards for their customers. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The exemption granted to the member banks, for instance on retailer commissions, is effective until May 30, 1999, but does not hold for other credit institutions possibly joining in the electronic cash system. The Finnish Competition Authority required that the other credit institutions joining in the system have the opportunity to determine independently all the payments to be collected, but no outside banking group has yet sought entry to the Avant electronic card system. On the other hand, there already exists an agreement in principle to integrate the Finnish Avant and the international VisaCash on the same chip (<em>i.e.</em> on the same cashcard) in the future. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The electronic cash decision of the Authority is highly important, as it bears direct links to future electronic trade conducted in the information networks (so-called electronic commerce) where the electronic cashcard will be one of the main payment methods. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Even though this network shopping will ideally be a highly cost-effective way to conduct trade, these cost benefits may quickly be lost if the <em>payment methods</em> in the trade are not cost effective enough, <em>e.g.</em> due to lack of effective competition. The decision of the Authority on the electronic cash system aims at preventing this. </div> <a id="co_anchor_10"></a><h2 class="co_headtext">Future Prospects</h2><div class="co_paragraph"> In Finland, the topic of electronic banking has recently been reviewed on an important forum. On July 11, 1997, the Ministry of Finance appointed an Evaluator to prepare a draft proposal on the reform of the financial market. According to the Evaluator's report, “the internationalisation of electronic payment transfer networks combined with different pay card services will mean, in time, a dramatic change in the retail trade of products and services. This will lead to a new competitive setting and emphasise the competition policy task of public authorities in keeping the payment transfer and other (banking) networks as open as possible.” The Evaluator clearly refers to how some payment transfer networks may be so indispensable to individual banking institutions that the competition authorities should (in certain circumstances) ensure the entry of all banks to these networks. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The central question from the competition law viewpoint is which is a genuinely indispensable electronic banking network for conducting modern banking business and which is not. Erroneous decisions by the competition authorities may result in the favouring of so-called free-riding, if incumbent banks are obliged to give new competitors access to their network without sufficient cause. This reduces the banks' interest in developing new, more costeffective solutions, which may, in the long run, lead to the weakening of the dynamic efficiency of the whole electronic payment system. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In Finland, the major ATM networks currently consist of cash dispensing and giro ATM networks. However, new ATM solutions and thus new ATM networks can be expected to enter into the banking market in the near future. At the same time, the task of the competition authorities is becoming ever more challenging with respect to network access, as the retail trade sector and telecommunications corporations will start to conduct banking operations even more aggressively than before. For instance, in Canada, representatives of retailers and insurance companies (that is, other than just deposit-taking institutions) have already argued for a more open use of the previously mentioned (and dominant) Interac network. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Even in these new market conditions, with new networks and new players, the objective of competition policy should be that banking business in the information networks will not form an entry barrier to new entrants, bearing in mind that the motivation of the incumbent banks for new innovations  <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S0396C9D0E74E11DAB6EDAFAEBAD7D114&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;364&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*364" />*J.I.B.L. 364</span>  should not be crushed by favouring solutions promoting free-riding. </div><div class="co_paragraph">   </div> <a id="co_anchor_11"></a><h2 class="co_headtext">Appendix: related literature</h2><div class="co_paragraph"> Emmons, W.R.

Barriers to entry, however, may surface, which usually represent one of three kinds: legal, economic or strategic. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Legal barriers refer, for example, to public regulation preventing the entry of new domestic or foreign banking institutions to a new banking market. However, in the common market, most of the legal barriers to the expansion of banks' operations to the other E.U. countries have been removed. In Finland, foreign banks face no legal barriers whatsoever to market entry. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Economic (or business-related) entry barriers refer to various business difficulties that foreign banks may face in the new market which may ultimately totally block their entry. In the banking industry, economic barriers may include high investment costs and the absence of economies of scale or economies of scope. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The competition authorities, however, have focused their energies on strategic entry barriers caused by the activities of the banks already operating in the markets. Today, the strategic barriers are increasingly related to different electronic banking services provided through various kinds of electronic banking networks. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The competition authorities should be concerned about these electronic banking services and networks, particularly when (a) the networks are being formed as joint ventures of several competing banks, or (b) the founders of the networks are unwilling, by joint agreement, to allow the entry of new competing banking institutions into them (so-called “network blocking”). </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Even though these situations should trigger the <em>interest</em> of the competition authorities, it does not necessarily mean that the establishment of joint ventures or even network blocking would be in conflict with workable competition. However, in order to tackle these situations, the competition authorities may first have to decide how far-reaching co-operation in the building of banking networks should be, in view of workable competition, and what are the efficiency arguments for the co-operation. Secondly, a critical look should be taken as to why new competitiors should be able to enter the networks in the first place, or whether they should simply start developing their own electronic banking services on a par with their competitors. The present article reviews some Finnish cases touching the issue. </div> <div class="doc_division"><a id="co_anchor_3"></a><h2 class="co_headtext doc_headText">Importance of Electronic Banking</h2><div class="co_paragraph"> Electronic banking may consist of many different banking services. Here, the author concentrates on the most common: payment services (such as bill payments or fund transfers) and different payment card services. The term <em>electronic</em> banking services derives from the way they are distributed to banking customers, <em>i.e.</em> through ATMs, the Internet, PCs and tele-banking links. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In Finland, the electronic development of the banking industry has been rapid. The number of electronic links between banks and their customers has increased sevenfold during the 1990s. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> For instance, of all Finnish corporate customers, some 80 per cent already manage their banking transactions with a direct electronic data link to their bank. On the other hand, the great majority of private customers' bill payments and other fund transfers are handled through giro ATMs, direct debiting or via the Internet. The use of the Internet, in particular, in banking services is rapidly growing, as nowadays almost every Finnish bank offers bill payments via the Internet. This is one reason why an estimated one quarter of the adult population handles the bulk of their banking business solely via the Internet. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The importance of electronic banking in the country is further attested by the fact that the use of ATMs in Finland is among the highest of the E.U. countries, when adjusted to population (see table). </div></div> <div class="doc_division"><a id="co_anchor_4"></a><h2 class="co_headtext doc_headText">Table 1: ATM transactions in the E.U. 1996</h2> <table style="width:100%;"> <tr valign="top"> <th class="co_hAlign2 co_vAlign3"></th> <th class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">No. per head</th> <th class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Total (in millions)</th> <th class="co_hAlign2 co_vAlign3">Per ATM per month</th> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Finland</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">44</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">218</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">7,888</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Sweden</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">32</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">285</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">9,960</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Netherlands</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">27</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">416</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">5,948</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">U.K.</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">25</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">1,452</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">5,492</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Ireland</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">24</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">84</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">7,050</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Portugal</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">22</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">212</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">3,262</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Denmark</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">21</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">110</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">4,011</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">France</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">19</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">1,102</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">3,735</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Austria</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">17</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">134</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">2,709</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Spain</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">16</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">649</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">1,812</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Belgium</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">15</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">156</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">3,044</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Germany</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">15</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">1,190</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">2,548</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Italy</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">9</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">522</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">1,634</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Greece</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">6</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">58</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">2,418</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Luxembourg</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">n/a</td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3"></td> <td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3"></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="4" class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3">Source: European Card Review, May-June 1997</td> </tr> </table>  <div class="co_paragraph">    <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S0396C9D0E74E11DAB6EDAFAEBAD7D114&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;360&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*360" />*J.I.B.L. 360</span>  In fact, the electronic development of the banking industry has advanced so quickly in Finland that, according to a survey conducted by the Bank of Finland, the rate of electronicisation of the payment systems between banks and their customers in Finland tops the whole of the E.U. According to the same survey, Finland will also continue to be a pioneer in the development of the field. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> As Finnish banking customers have quickly adopted the use of electronic banking services, it may not necessarily be possible for a foreign bank to succeed in the Finnish banking business without offering high-level electronic banking service networks to its Finnish customers. For this reason, potential network blocking issues have been central in the application of competition policy to the country's banking industry. </div></div> <div class="doc_division"><a id="co_anchor_5"></a><h2 class="co_headtext doc_headText">Co-operation</h2><div class="co_paragraph"> In a country such as Finland, which is sparsely populated and has a fairly small number of residents, it has been a rational choice for several incumbent banks to jointly build the basic infrastructure for electronic banking services. On the other hand, maintaining the infrastructure is also likely to be costly: a further incentive for co-operation. Economies of scale are often related to electronic banking services, <em>i.e.</em> the higher the number of banks whose transactions the clearing system process, the lower the costs of individual transactions, which clearly benefits those banks that are members of the clearing system. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In addition to cost benefits, in some cases, the banks' co-operation has also made it possible to develop increasingly sophisticated service applications for customers. Thus, co-operation may have effects which increase the dynamic efficiency of the market. But in spite of the potential positive effects of cooperation among the incumbent banks, co-operation can create market power and entry barriers too. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Problems may arise primarily because the new foreign banks seeking entry may have some well-grounded business or legal (antitrust) motives to obtain access to the already existing electronic banking systems, particularly if building or maintaining a parallel electronic banking network on their own will be non-profitable due to the competition with the incumbent banks' joint venture, where the (sunk or operating) costs can be jointly shared by a number of banks. Foreign banks do not necessarily--alone or together--have the same economic opportunities to create their own electronic banking system, which would, either in scope or volume of use, correspond to the capacity of the joint networks of the traditional, incumbent banks. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Since co-operation in different electronic banking joint venture systems frequently creates economies of scale and hence significant cost benefits, blocking access to the joint venture may act as an entry barrier to new competitors, unless they are able to join in the same cost-saving collaboration. This can mean that, unless foreign banks are able to join the incumbent banks' collaboration on electronic banking services, they may not be able to offer some of their banking services in a sufficiently cost-effective manner in Finland. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> However, the competition authorities must be cautious in their network blocking decisions not to allow free riders and not unduly to weaken the banks' motivation to further develop their operations. The main question, therefore, is which banking networks can be considered essential for their existence in the Finnish banking market, and on what terms the new entrants should be able to join the existing networks. There follows a review of topical Finnish cases. </div></div> <div class="doc_division"><a id="co_anchor_6"></a><h2 class="co_headtext doc_headText">Case Law in Finland</h2><div class="co_paragraph">   </div></div> <h3 class="co_headtext">Automatia ATM Ltd (1995)</h3><div class="co_paragraph"> Merita Bank, Okobank Group Central Cooperative Bank and Leonia Bank Ltd (formerly Postipankki Ltd) are the three largest banks in Finland. The joint market share of these banks of banking services to household customers is around 90 per cent. In 1994, these banks set up a co-operative joint venture for the administering and running of the daily operations of their ATMs. All the cash dispensing ATMs of the member banks were made subject to the company Automatia ATM Ltd. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The banks applied for an exemption to their cooperation from the Finnish Competition Authority, as they had agreed on interbank fees in order to compensate the use of jointly run ATMs to each other. Additionally, the member banks had agreed not to compete with Automatia in the cash dispensing ATM services. In practice, this led to the forming of one cash dispensing ATM chain operating under a common brand from three competing cash dispensing ATM networks. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The founding of the joint venture was supported by the cost savings (cost efficiencies) resulting from the joint maintenance of the machines. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The Finnish Competition Authority approved the operations of the co-operative joint venture set up for the joint administering of the cash dispensing ATMs. However, in its decision, the Authority emphasised that the joint use of the ATMs benefits customers only if each bank participating in the joint use independently decides on the fees to be collected from its own customers. The member banks agreed to the terms set by the Authority and the exemption was granted till the end of 2005. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Now that three years have passed since the decision, it can be estimated that the approval of the Automatia co-operation has increased the cost efficiency of Finnish ATM services. The co-operation has evidently benefited banking customers, too, precisely because, in spite of the Automatia co-operation, the member banks must independently price the  <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S0396C9D0E74E11DAB6EDAFAEBAD7D114&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;361&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*361" />*J.I.B.L. 361</span>  ATM fees they collect from their customers. This means that the member banks continuously compete with each other, price included, thus fulfilling the basic requirement that the cost efficiency of the Automatia co-operation must also benefit member banks' customers. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Even now, as prior to the exemption application, the Automatia ATM joint venture covers about 90 per cent of all the cash dispensing ATMs used in the country. However, no competing (<em>e.g.</em> foreign) banking institutions or other enterprises have yet sought entry to it. Should this happen, the Authority would have to investigate whether cash withdrawals from the ATMs should be defined as a relevant market of their own. The present member banks of the Automatia joint venture would be likely to point out then that cash withdrawals are now possible even from some retail store counters, so that customers have access to other cash distributing channels than ATMs. The network entrants would probably not share this view. Hence, market definition will always be the key question even in network blocking cases. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In this respect, it is interesting to make a comparison with a famous Texas antitrust case on cash dispensing ATMs and its market definition, in particular. In this famous Pulse arbitration, Professor Kauper namely rejected the proposed markets of “all payment systems” and “all means of obtaining cash” and identified instead a narrow retail market of “ATM services”, on the grounds that “there is [in Texas] a significant group of ATM users who value the characteristics of ATMs and for whom other means of obtaining cash are not reasonable substitutes”. He thus concluded that “ATMs are themselves a relevant, if fragile, market for antitrust purposes”. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In Canada, too, the competition authorities have taken a stand on the position of ATM networks from a competition law viewpoint. Interac, the most extensive cash dispensing ATM network in Canada, was originally controlled by nine major Canadian banks, trust companies and credit union societies. These institutions jointly controlled the Interac network, which allowed customers to use banking cards to withdraw cash from ATMs bearing an Interac logo. In the consent order given by the Canadian Competition Tribunal in 1996, Interac was found to be in a dominant position as the provider of ATM services and was obliged to operate as a non-profit corporation. Interac had to open up its network to all other potential deposit-taking financial institutions on a non-discriminatory basis. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In addition to market definition, these two cases display the other important feature involved in network blocking cases: the number of substitutes in the different banking markets can vary from each other. The basic reason for this is that, in the banking industry, the level of technical development and therefore the “demand culture” often differs from one country to another (and from one market to another). </div> <h3 class="co_headtext">Merita Bank v. Handelsbanken (1996)</h3><div class="co_paragraph"> One of the new active entrants in the Finnish banking market is the Swedish-owned bank Svenska Handelsbanken. Although its market share is still less than 5 per cent, it has steadily increased its share both among Finnish corporate and household customers. Merita Bank, on the other hand, is in many ways Finland's largest bank. It has, for example, around three million private customers in Finland (out of Finland's population of five million). Furthermore, the bank itself estimates that some 60 per cent of the country's small and medium-sized enterprises use Merita Bank's services as their first choice. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Customers can pay their bills and transfer funds from their bank accounts, for instance, via the giro ATMs. Two years ago, Svenska Handelsbanken inquired from the Finnish Competition Authority whether the giro ATM network should be considered essential for foreign banks' businesses and whether Merita Bank should provide open access to its own giro ATM network. Thus Svenska Handelsbanken called into question whether Merita might reserve the giro ATMs for its own customers only. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The case was interesting in at least two ways. First, at the time the case was opened, Merita controlled about 60 per cent of all the giro ATMs in the country. Secondly, in Finland, giro ATMs are one of the major fund transfer channels, as around 40 per cent of private customers conduct all their payment transfers via the giro ATMs. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The Finnish Competition Authority, however, held that Merita had no obligation to allow other banks access to the giro ATM network it had built for its own customers. The primary grounds included the lack of indication why Svenska Handelsbanken could not organise the provision of giro services on its own via other distribution channels. The Authority referred to direct debiting, telephone banking possibilities and PC connections (the Internet included) as such alternative distribution channels. In other words, by its market definition, the Authority demonstrated that, in the case in question, entry into Merita Bank's giro ATM network was not essential for the operations of the foreign bank. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In addition to alternative distribution channels, it was not shown why Svenska Handelsbanken could not build a competing giro ATM network itself for the regions in which it operates in Finland. Since Svenska Handelsbanken was already able to compete with Merita in payment transfer, the promotion of competition did not require Merita to allow Svenska Handelsbanken access to its giro ATM network. The Authority did not directly refer to free-riding, but this clearly was one of the background issues. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Looking back, it is even harder now to argue for a different kind of decision by the Authority, particularly because Internet payments, for instance, have dramatically increased their popularity among household customers. To take Merita Bank itself as an example, of its three million private customers, already some 450,000 own a password to the bank's  <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S0396C9D0E74E11DAB6EDAFAEBAD7D114&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;362&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*362" />*J.I.B.L. 362</span>  Internet payment services. There is no reason to believe that the proportion of Internet customers in other Finnish banks would greatly differ from Merita's figures. The Internet payment services are thus a genuine alternative distribution channel for the giro ATMs. </div> <h3 class="co_headtext">Automatia cashcards (1997)</h3><div class="co_paragraph"> In June 1996, the Finnish Competition Authority received an exemption application for co-operation within the electronic cash (or electronic purse) system from Merita Bank, Okobank Group Central Cooperative and Leonia (Postipankki) (the “member banks”) who had set up a company called Automatia Electronic Purse Ltd (see Figure 1). </div><div class="co_paragraph co_imageResearch"> <span class="co_nonDisplayableImage">Tabular or graphic material set at this point is not displayable.</span> </div><span class="co_docFigureDescription"></span><div class="co_paragraph"> The Avant electronic cash system which the company represents is based on two types of cashcards: reloadable and disposable cashcards. Both types of cards are used identically for paying for a wide variety of services, <em>e.g.</em> payphones, parking, public transport, municipal services, canteens, kiosks and shops. All payment transactions with the Avant electronic cashcard are anonymous. The key idea of the electronic purse is to replace hard cash (coins) and to diminish the costs caused by the use of coins. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In its decision on the exemption application, the Finnish Competition Authority held that the cooperation between the member banks within the electronic cash system promotes the entry of new means of payment into the markets and the technical development of the field. The co-operation eliminates the duplication of costs, thus increasing economic efficiency. An extensive electronic cash system and the possibility of using a new method of payment, replacing hard cash, benefits customers and consumers. The cost savings may be considerable, as in Finland around 80 per cent of household payments are paid by cash, and cash payments are, in general, a more expensive payment method for the economy  <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S0396C9D0E74E11DAB6EDAFAEBAD7D114&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;363&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*363" />*J.I.B.L. 363</span>  compared to different kinds of on-line payment card transactions. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> According to Automatia, all credit institutions which are part of the Finnish interbank clearing system can join in the electronic cash system as the issuers of reloadable Avant smart cards. However, an entry fee and an annual fee will be collected from credit institutions joining the electronic cashcard system; these fees will be jointly determined by the member banks. The Finnish Competition Authority found that this price co-operation violated the prohibition of Article 6 of the Competition Act. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In the system, customers are able to reload their electronic purse cards at the ATMs directly from their personal bank accounts. According to the exemption application, Automatia collects a reload charge from electronic cashcard customers jointly set by the member banks. However, the Authority found that price co-operation on the member banks' reload charges would severely restrict the electronic cashcard customers' possibilities for tendering different banks in the electronic cashcard system, and held that no exemption is granted to the price collaboration on the member banks' reloading and unloading services. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> On the other hand, the Authority found that price collaboration on retailer commissions is justified at the early stages of the system because it decreases the negotiating costs related to the marketing of the new cashcard and because it is to be expected that the resulting efficiency benefits will primarily accrue to the customers and the consumers. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Furthermore, the member banks had agreed that they would not act in co-operation with other electronic cashcard systems possibly competing with Automatia. The Finnish Competition Authority required that the member banks dissolve this noncompetition clause by December 31, 1997, so that it will not prevent the member banks from joining cashcard transactions to various memory, function and smart card operations, and that the member banks continue to have the incentive to further develop their own reloading services of cashcards for their customers. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The exemption granted to the member banks, for instance on retailer commissions, is effective until May 30, 1999, but does not hold for other credit institutions possibly joining in the electronic cash system. The Finnish Competition Authority required that the other credit institutions joining in the system have the opportunity to determine independently all the payments to be collected, but no outside banking group has yet sought entry to the Avant electronic card system. On the other hand, there already exists an agreement in principle to integrate the Finnish Avant and the international VisaCash on the same chip (<em>i.e.</em> on the same cashcard) in the future. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The electronic cash decision of the Authority is highly important, as it bears direct links to future electronic trade conducted in the information networks (so-called electronic commerce) where the electronic cashcard will be one of the main payment methods. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Even though this network shopping will ideally be a highly cost-effective way to conduct trade, these cost benefits may quickly be lost if the <em>payment methods</em> in the trade are not cost effective enough, <em>e.g.</em> due to lack of effective competition. The decision of the Authority on the electronic cash system aims at preventing this. </div> <div class="doc_division"><a id="co_anchor_10"></a><h2 class="co_headtext doc_headText">Future Prospects</h2><div class="co_paragraph"> In Finland, the topic of electronic banking has recently been reviewed on an important forum. On July 11, 1997, the Ministry of Finance appointed an Evaluator to prepare a draft proposal on the reform of the financial market. According to the Evaluator's report, “the internationalisation of electronic payment transfer networks combined with different pay card services will mean, in time, a dramatic change in the retail trade of products and services. This will lead to a new competitive setting and emphasise the competition policy task of public authorities in keeping the payment transfer and other (banking) networks as open as possible.” The Evaluator clearly refers to how some payment transfer networks may be so indispensable to individual banking institutions that the competition authorities should (in certain circumstances) ensure the entry of all banks to these networks. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The central question from the competition law viewpoint is which is a genuinely indispensable electronic banking network for conducting modern banking business and which is not. Erroneous decisions by the competition authorities may result in the favouring of so-called free-riding, if incumbent banks are obliged to give new competitors access to their network without sufficient cause. This reduces the banks' interest in developing new, more costeffective solutions, which may, in the long run, lead to the weakening of the dynamic efficiency of the whole electronic payment system. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In Finland, the major ATM networks currently consist of cash dispensing and giro ATM networks. However, new ATM solutions and thus new ATM networks can be expected to enter into the banking market in the near future. At the same time, the task of the competition authorities is becoming ever more challenging with respect to network access, as the retail trade sector and telecommunications corporations will start to conduct banking operations even more aggressively than before. For instance, in Canada, representatives of retailers and insurance companies (that is, other than just deposit-taking institutions) have already argued for a more open use of the previously mentioned (and dominant) Interac network. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Even in these new market conditions, with new networks and new players, the objective of competition policy should be that banking business in the information networks will not form an entry barrier to new entrants, bearing in mind that the motivation of the incumbent banks for new innovations  <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S0396C9D0E74E11DAB6EDAFAEBAD7D114&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;364&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*364" />*J.I.B.L. 364</span>  should not be crushed by favouring solutions promoting free-riding. </div><div class="co_paragraph">   </div></div> <div class="doc_division"><a id="co_anchor_11"></a><h2 class="co_headtext doc_headText">Appendix: related literature</h2><div class="co_paragraph"> Emmons, W.R.

It is simply the question of how much harm or loss has been caused by the defendant’s breach of duty. In practice the application of this question has often proven to be a most vexed issue. This has particularly been the case in the field of asbestos litigation.  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/IAE31B790D3EA11E5BAC2A3D33FB3F855/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Heneghan</a>  is the latest instalment in a series of cases in this area which have exposed some of the difficulties with the conventional approach adopted by the courts to deal with the issue of causation. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Generally when considering issues of causation the appeal courts have had to balance two aims. On the one hand they must adopt a coherent set of principles. At the same time, they must do justice to an individual and ensure that they do actually obtain redress when it is fair and reasonable for them to do so. By seeking to achieve both aims the law in this area can often end up like a tangled knot that is difficult to unravel. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The general rule of causation is the "but for" test. The claimant must prove that <em>but for</em> the defendant’s breach of duty, they would not have suffered the harm or loss in question. The onus is on the claimant to prove this causal link on a balance of probabilities. This approach ensures that the claimant is compensated for the harm the defendant’s wrongdoing caused to them, but also that a defendant does not have to compensate another party for harm or loss that they probably did not cause or which would have arisen in any event. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The field of industrial disease litigation has on several occasions tested the limits of the "but for" test as a means to deliver justice. This has prompted the courts to seek a different approach to causation in certain circumstances. Historically the first significant divergence from the traditional "but for" test was confirmed in  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/I768F6F21E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Bonnington Castings</a> . </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/I768F6F21E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Bonnington Castings</a>  the claimant’s employment exposed him to silica dust which gradually over time collected in his lungs resulting in pneumoconiosis. Part of the exposure was caused by his employer’s negligence but a larger contribution came from non-negligent exposure to the dust. In short, the cause of the condition was two separate sources and the defendant was only responsible for one of these. It could not be established that on a balance of probabilities the condition would have arisen but for the defendant’s negligent exposure. However, it was held that the dust arising from the employer’s negligent exposure had <em>materially contributed</em> to the claimant developing the disease. The defendant’s negligent exposure, whilst not being the only source or agent resulting in the harm, was nevertheless considered to be sufficient to establish the causal link for the employer to be held liable to compensate their employee for the condition. </div><div class="co_paragraph">   <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/I768F6F21E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Bonnington Castings</a>  now stands as the authority for a broadly applicable principle in the law of causation. In a situation where a defendant’s breach is one of a number of agents which bring about a specific harm or loss, so long as the defendant’s breach is not de minimis, and that it materially contributed to the outcome, they can be held liable for that outcome. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The ability of this approach to do justice to the parties was challenged by the circumstances considered by the House of Lords in  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/IA5412B60E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Fairchild</a> . Here each of the claimants had worked for several employers, all of whom had negligently exposed them to asbestos. Each claimant had developed mesothelioma, a form of cancer which is almost always fatal. The medical evidence that was given in the proceedings established that it might have been just one single asbestos fibre inhaled at some unknown point during each claimant’s working lives that triggered the process that lead to the development of the cancer. This left the claimants <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S44C1E36022D311E696008D1CBA1BBC27&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;86&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*86" />*J.P.I.L. C86</span>  with a difficulty when it came to establishing causation. How could they prove which of their employers had exposed them to the specific fibre that caused the mesothelioma? It could not be said that every fibre they had inhaled during their various employments had cumulatively added to the development of the condition (unlike the silica dust that gradually built up in the Mr Bonnington’s lungs). </div><div class="co_paragraph"> On the conventional approach to causation the claimants could not discharge the burden of proof that any of the identified employers had caused or materially contributed to the condition. If followed this approach would have meant that the claims would have failed.

They found that each employer, through their negligent exposure to asbestos, had materially increased the risk of the claimants developing mesothelioma. The claimant need only establish that the defendant’s exposure materially increased the risk that they would develop mesothelioma. This enabled the claimants to recover damages from an employer even though it was possible that fibres from their negligent exposure never actually caused the condition. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The sting in the tail of the " <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/IA5412B60E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Fairchild</a>  exception" came a few years later with the decision of the House of Lords in  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/I6F686120E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Barker</a> .<sup id="co_footnoteReference_6"><a href="#co_footnote_6" class="co_footnoteReference">6</a></sup> Mr Barker had died of mesothelioma after he had been exposed to asbestos during three periods of his working life.

Applying the  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/IA5412B60E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Fairchild</a>  exception, the claimant was able to establish that the defendant’s exposure had materially increased the risk of his developing mesothelioma.

Mr Heneghan had died of lung cancer after being exposed to large amounts of asbestos dust during his working life with multiple employers. He was only able to bring his action against six of those employers who between them had contributed 35 per cent of his lifetime exposure to asbestos. Epidemiological evidence confirms that the more asbestos someone is exposed to the greater the risk of developing lung cancer. It was generally accepted in this litigation that if the amount of exposure to asbestos more than doubled the risk of developing lung cancer then it could be said that it has, on a balance of probabilities, caused the condition. Here Mr Heneghan’s lifetime exposure to asbestos gave a more than fivefold increase in the risk so it was not in doubt that his cancer was caused by asbestos. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Following the  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/IA5412B60E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Fairchild</a>  exception, each defendant had materially increased the risk of Mr Heneghan developing lung cancer and could be held liable for this.

This meant that the claim against the six defendants was restricted to 35 per cent of its full value, that being the percentage of the total lifetime exposure for which the defendants were responsible.  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/IF468DA7022BC11DB801C928704B2506D/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">

It is simply the question of how much harm or loss has been caused by the defendant’s breach of duty. In practice the application of this question has often proven to be a most vexed issue. This has particularly been the case in the field of asbestos litigation.  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/IAE31B790D3EA11E5BAC2A3D33FB3F855/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Heneghan</a>  is the latest instalment in a series of cases in this area which have exposed some of the difficulties with the conventional approach adopted by the courts to deal with the issue of causation. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> Generally when considering issues of causation the appeal courts have had to balance two aims. On the one hand they must adopt a coherent set of principles. At the same time, they must do justice to an individual and ensure that they do actually obtain redress when it is fair and reasonable for them to do so. By seeking to achieve both aims the law in this area can often end up like a tangled knot that is difficult to unravel. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The general rule of causation is the "but for" test. The claimant must prove that <em>but for</em> the defendant’s breach of duty, they would not have suffered the harm or loss in question. The onus is on the claimant to prove this causal link on a balance of probabilities. This approach ensures that the claimant is compensated for the harm the defendant’s wrongdoing caused to them, but also that a defendant does not have to compensate another party for harm or loss that they probably did not cause or which would have arisen in any event. </div><div class="co_paragraph"> The field of industrial disease litigation has on several occasions tested the limits of the "but for" test as a means to deliver justice. This has prompted the courts to seek a different approach to causation in certain circumstances. Historically the first significant divergence from the traditional "but for" test was confirmed in  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/I768F6F21E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Bonnington Castings</a> . </div><div class="co_paragraph"> In  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/I768F6F21E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Bonnington Castings</a>  the claimant’s employment exposed him to silica dust which gradually over time collected in his lungs resulting in pneumoconiosis. Part of the exposure was caused by his employer’s negligence but a larger contribution came from non-negligent exposure to the dust. In short, the cause of the condition was two separate sources and the defendant was only responsible for one of these. It could not be established that on a balance of probabilities the condition would have arisen but for the defendant’s negligent exposure. However, it was held that the dust arising from the employer’s negligent exposure had <em>materially contributed</em> to the claimant developing the disease. The defendant’s negligent exposure, whilst not being the only source or agent resulting in the harm, was nevertheless considered to be sufficient to establish the causal link for the employer to be held liable to compensate their employee for the condition. </div><div class="co_paragraph">   <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/I768F6F21E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Bonnington Castings</a>  now stands as the authority for a broadly applicable principle in the law of causation.

Here each of the claimants had worked for several employers, all of whom had negligently exposed them to asbestos. Each claimant had developed mesothelioma, a form of cancer which is almost always fatal. The medical evidence that was given in the proceedings established that it might have been just one single asbestos fibre inhaled at some unknown point during each claimant’s working lives that triggered the process that lead to the development of the cancer. This left the claimants <span class="co_starPage"><input type="hidden" class="co_starPageMetadataItem" value="{ &quot;pageset&quot;: &quot;S44C1E36022D311E696008D1CBA1BBC27&quot;, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: &quot;86&quot; }" alt="metadata" data-star-page="*86" />*J.P.I.L.

It could not be said that every fibre they had inhaled during their various employments had cumulatively added to the development of the condition (unlike the silica dust that gradually built up in the Mr Bonnington’s lungs). </div><div class="co_paragraph"> On the conventional approach to causation the claimants could not discharge the burden of proof that any of the identified employers had caused or materially contributed to the condition.

They found that each employer, through their negligent exposure to asbestos, had materially increased the risk of the claimants developing mesothelioma.

Certainly in the context of clinical negligence litigation, attempts to establish that negligent treatment materially increased risk of an outcome have so far been rejected, specifically in  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/I01A12120E42911DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Wiltshire</a> .<sup id="co_footnoteReference_9"><a href="#co_footnote_9" class="co_footnoteReference">9</a></sup> Nevertheless, in situations where the precise mechanism by which a defendant’s negligence causes a condition is unknown but where epidemiological evidence shows that the breach has materially increased the risk of such an outcome, the  <a href="http://www.next.ci.westlaw.com/Document/IA5412B60E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem">Fairchild</a>  exception might potentially provide a means by which causation could be established. </div></div> <div class="doc_division"><a id="co_anchor_5"></a><h2 class="co_headtext doc_headText">Practice points</h2><div><ul class="co_docContentBodyUnorderedList"><li>  In asbestos-related lung cancer cases it is the correct approach to causation to consider if a defendant’s exposure materially increased the risk of developing lung cancer, although a defendant is only liable in proportion to their own contribution to the exposure.  </li><li>  Causation can potentially be established by adopting a test of material increase in risk in other disease cases other than asbestos-related cancers.  </li></ul></div></div> <div class="co_paragraph">  <strong>Richard Geraghty</strong>  </div> </div>
